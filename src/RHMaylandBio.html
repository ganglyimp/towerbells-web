Mayland</b> was the third and youngest child of silversmith George Mayland, who emigrated from England to the USA about 1841,accompanied by his wife (Sarah) and their firstborn child.&nbsp;A daughter was born to them in Connecticut, but by the time Rowland was born,they had settled in Brooklyn, New York, where they remained.&nbsp;(See <a href="#RES">Residences</a>, below.)&nbsp;George carried on the silversmithing trade there until at least the mid-1880s,but his date of death and place of burial have not yet been found.&nbsp;None of his children followed the silversmithing trade, at least not directly,and the fate of the older two has not been discovered.&nbsp;(See <a href="#GEN">Genealogy</a>, below.)<p>Rowland H. Mayland married young, and about that same time he went into business as a manufacturer of musical instruments.&nbsp;(See <a href="#BUS">Business History</a>, below.)&nbsp;Business directories of the day give no clue as to what types of musical instrumentshe made, but other evidence shows that there was quite a variety.&nbsp;(See <a href="#REF">References</a>, below.)&nbsp;At some point, he became the first American manufacturer of what are now called English handbells,and that may be reflected in the later business directories which list his occupationas "musical bells".<p>Rowland's wife, Julia, had the distinction of having been born at seawhile en route to America.&nbsp;The only certainty about her family is the fact of their being English.&nbsp;However, it is possible that they immigrated through Canada, because in the 1880 US censusJulia gave her place of birth as Canada rather than "At Sea."&nbsp;It is also possible that their family name was Stanley(see Mayland &amp; Stanley under <a href="#BUS">Business History</a>, below);if that is correct, then the names of her parents and siblings are also known.&nbsp;Rowland and Julia had two sons and a daughter, in the same order as his parents had done.&nbsp;The older son became an engineer, and seems to have moved around quite a bitbefore settling in California.&nbsp;The daughter lived at home, and did not marry until after herfather's death.&nbsp;But she must have been a great favorite of her parents, because she was alwaysknown by her nickname rather than her given name until after she married.&nbsp;Only the younger son followed his father into the musical instrument business.&nbsp;<p>In addition to being an artisan and businessman, Rowland was a musician.&nbsp;As a youth during the Civil War, he enlisted in the 56th New York Volunteers,where he served as drum major.&nbsp;(Many years later, this service entitled his widow to a veteran's pension.)&nbsp;Possibly he continued service with this band after the war,because later he was described as having been its bandmaster.<p>As a young man, he played the flute in several different minstrel groups inBrooklyn, and was sufficiently well known to be able to contribute significantlyto the writing of a book on minstrelsy many years afterward.&nbsp;In his middle years, he was sometimes a flute soloist at more genteelmusical entertainments, accompanied by his daughter at the piano.<p>Rowland seems to have been of an inventive turn of mind, because he was issuedfour patents over the course of a decade, as follows:<ul>	<li>No.531,323 (Dec.25, 1894) - Musical instrument		<br>(composed of vibratory bars of wood, metal, etc., with resonators)	<li>No.578,253 (Mar.2,1897) - Bell		<br>(a striker/damper combination for handbells, chimes, etc.)	<li>No.663,085 (Dec.4, 1900) - Clock-chime		<br>(tubular bells with weighted top ends)	<li>No.770,437 (Sep.20, 1940) - Bell		<br>(tap bell with internal resonator chamber)</ul>He was also the assignor of a patent issued to Robert J. Carson of New York Cityin 1903 (No.741,625, Oct.20) for a "Strength-testing or punching machine,"which was evidently intended to be coin operated, as in an entertainment arcade.&nbsp;<p>Rowland was also quite civic minded.&nbsp;He became well known as a volunteer fireman, and eventually wasa key figure in the establishment of a firemen's home in Hudson, New York,and thereafter a trustee of it.&nbsp;After moving his family from Brooklyn to Freeport, Long Island, he becameVice President of the Freeport Board of Education, and also served asPresident of the Board of Health.&nbsp;He was one of the organizers of the Freeport Lodge of Elks.<p>In 1909, Rowland H. Mayland was one of three directors of the Eaton-Hough Companyof New York City, a firm which seems to have had some involvement with calculating machines.<p>Rowland Mayland died at his home in Freeport, at the age of 68.&nbsp;The cause of his death and the place of his burial have not been discovered.&nbsp;He was survived by his wife and all three of their children,and the results of his long-lasting business have survived to the present day.</p><hr><a name="GEN"> </a><h1>Mayland Genealogy</h1><b>George Mayland</b>, patriarch of this family<DL><DT>Vitals:</DT>	<DD>b.c.1816 in England; d.1884 or later in NY?</DD>	<DD>m.c.1838 in England + Sarah ?

Mayland in that year.&nbsp;		So he must have been one of the partners.&nbsp;		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Brooklyn city directories, unlike those of many other cities, 		rarely included the names of principals in partnership or corporate entries,		and personal entries for such principals rarely included the name of the partnership		or company in which they were involved.&nbsp;		That makes it difficult to trace the management of such businesses.&nbsp;		In this case, however, there is additional supporting evidence.		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; From at least as early as 1878, Edwin J. Stanley had been working 		in the same business and at the same address as Rowland H. Mayland.&nbsp;		They even had the same residence address at least once.&nbsp;		In 1885, Edwin's business address was that of the Mayland &amp; Stanley partnership,		leading to the obvious conclusion that he was the other partner in this venture.&nbsp;		Furthermore, in subsequent years he continued in the same business at the same		address, even though Rowland H. Mayland was no longer involved at that location.&nbsp;		Eventually he moved his business to other addresses, but he continued in the same		line of work until about 1896, after which he disappeared from the city directories.		<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; There is circumstantial evidence that Edwin J. Stanley		was Rowland H. Mayland's brother-in-law.&nbsp;		Edwin had a sister named Julia, who disappeared from U.S. census records		about the time that Rowland acquired a wife named Julia, of about the same age.&nbsp;		Furthermore, Rowland and Julia named their second son Edwin Stanley Mayland.&nbsp;		(See <a href="#GEN">Genealogy</a>, above.)&nbsp;		Also, Edwin and his brother Franklin and his widowed mother Annie may have been living		with the Maylands in 1880.&nbsp;		For these reasons, Julia's maiden name has been shown as Stanley.		in the <a href="#GEN">Genealogy</a>, above.	<LI><b>American Bell &amp; Chime Company</b><br>		This business name appears in the Brooklyn directories only in 1900 and 1902,		both times at the same address as Rowland H. Mayland (351 Adams).&nbsp;		The first year, its business is "Automatic Slot Machines;"		the second year, it is simply "bells."&nbsp;		But note that this is also about the time that a patent for a coin-operated machine		was assigned to Rowland (see above).&nbsp;		This seems to indicate that his business interests were somewhat diverse.	<LI><b>R. H. Mayland's Son</b><br>		After the death of Rowland H. Mayland, if not before,		the name of the firm was changed, 		and it was advertised as such in trade journals.&nbsp;		(See cut below).&nbsp;		The name <b>R. H. Mayland &amp; Son</b>, which is occasionally seen		in various writings of others, 		is probably a misinterpretation of the rather unusual actual name.&nbsp;		The firm remained at the Willoughby Street address in Brooklyn 		throughout the lifetime of Edwin Stanley Mayland.	<LI><b>Mayland Chimes</b><br>		At some point, the name of the firm was changed to this final form.&nbsp;		It is well known that Mayland supplied sets of tubular chimes to clockmakers 		for use in longcase ("grandfather") clocks with Westminster quarter-chime		actions.&nbsp;		Mayland also supplied sets of rod chimes for similar use in shelf or bracket clocks,		and these are equally well known among clock enthusiasts.&nbsp;		However, aside from the two Mayland tower chimes which are listed in these pages, 		there seems to be no substantive evidence of Mayland's work in this field.&nbsp;		Undoubtedly, much remains to be discovered.	</UL><p>The Meneely/Troy bellfoundry supplied a 159-pound bell to R.H.Mayland's Son of Brooklyn NYon Apr.13, 1905.&nbsp;Presumably this would have been a factory bell.&nbsp;It is not known whether the year is a typo or whether this is evidence that Mayland, now nearly sixty years of age, had effectively turned the business over to his son.&nbsp;However, up to 1913 this business name did not appear in the Brooklyn city directories.&nbsp;<p>The business was relocated to Lakeside, Connecticut, in the late 1960sby Edwin Stanley Mayland, Jr.&nbsp;It has been reported that in 1977 the business was sold to the Verdin Companyof Cincinnati; but whether that is correct, and what happened thereafter,are unclear, because other evidence indicates that at least part of the businesscontinued until the  death of Edwin Stanley Mayland, Jr.&nbsp;Nowadays, both Mayland and Deagan organ chimes are being sold by Organ Supply Companyof Erie, PA, and OSC's literature indicates that they have been doing so since 1993.<p>For an index to pages about all of the known tubular tower chimes made by Mayland, click <A HREF="data/IXTUmakerOther.html#MD">here</A>.</p><p align=center>The following advertisement appeared in an organ-related publication in the year of Rowland H.
