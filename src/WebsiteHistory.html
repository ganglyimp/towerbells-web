Website History</SMALL><hr><H1>History of the TowerBells Website</H1><p><B>Background</B><br>The author/owner/Webmaster has been collecting information about carillons for morethan six decades, having learned to play that instrumentwhile an undergraduate at Trinity College (Hartford, CT).&nbsp;He joined The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America (GCNA),and became a Carillonneur Member, which he remains today.&nbsp;In the course of his professional life in another field, he developed expertisein the use of computers to organize information, and eventually found a way to usethat expertise in building a database of information about carillons.&nbsp;Recognizing that there are other types of instruments made of cast bells besidesthe traditional carillons that are the focus of the Guild's interest,he expanded that database over time to include carillons with non-traditional mechanisms,chimes (some of which have been expanded to become traditional carillons)and rings (tower bells hung for change-ringing).&nbsp;In the 1970s, some attempts were made to publish information from this databaseusing conventional methods of the day, as recorded in the <a href="data/Hardcopy.html#hist">hardcopy history</a> here.&nbsp;But that was ultimately impractical because some parts of the informationchanged so rapidly that a book would be obsolete before it left the bindery.<p><B>Phase 1 - GCNA Website</B><br>The advent of the World Wide Web changed the situation, making it possibleto publish information in a way that allowed it to be updated as frequentlyas desired.&nbsp;When the Guild established a Website in late 1996, the author volunteered to makehis data available as an annex or attachment to that Website.&nbsp;Doing this required modification of the report generator program previously usedfor the production of <u>Bulletin</u> articles and custom hardcopy, so as to generate the basic material appropriate for Webpages.&nbsp;Initially only information about the traditional carillons of North Americawas posted, but later that was expanded to include information about non-traditionalcarillons, chimes and rings in the same region.&nbsp;Eventually the geographic coverage was expanded to include the world,although it was still incomplete for the "big four" countries in Europe -Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands.&nbsp;Details of this extended development can be found in the "What's New" pagesretained from the GCNA Website.<p><B>Phase 2 - TowerBells Website in parallel</B><br>Meanwhile, the author was accumulating other bell-related material whichcould not be made to fit logically into the carillon-based annex to the Guild Website.&nbsp;This led to the establishment of TowerBells.org in early 2000.&nbsp;At first that was hosted at Intec, a local St.Louis company which provided dial-upInternet access (via 19.2 kilobaud modem).&nbsp;When that firm became defunct, the author had to find a different method of accessto the Internet.&nbsp;After a period of turmoil, DSL access through Southwestern Bell (later SBC),the local public telephone utility, was acquired;<!-- <A HREF="http://www.swbell.com/"></A> -->since the service packageincluded some personal Web space, TowerBells.org was re-hosted in a subdirectorythere.&nbsp;<!-- <A HREF="http://home.swbell.net/csz_stl/"></A> -->(The service package also included email, thus providing the start of the author'sprincipal email address.)&nbsp;As is well known, SBC eventually merged with AT&amp;T; fortunately the Internetservice offerings were continued unchanged.&nbsp;In this time period, TowerBells.org was being expanded with information abouttubular tower chimes (which are made of a metal similar to the bronze of conventionaltower bells) and about the St.Louis bellfounders (a subject which the authorhas researched extensively).&nbsp;Details of this extended development can be found in the "What's New" pageretained from the previous versions of the TowerBells Website.&nbsp;It is important to note that the tubular tower chime information was stored in thesame database as the information about instruments made of conventional tower bells -carillons, chimes, etc.<p>Unfortunately, AT&amp;T eventually terminated their personal Web hosting servicefor customers to whom they were providing Internet access.&nbsp;This forced another re-hosting of TowerBells.org, this time to the author'spersonal Web space under Apple Computer's dot-Mac service.&nbsp;That service was later transformed into the MobileMe service, but in 2011 Appleannounced that it would be terminated at the end of June 2012.&nbsp;This set the stage for yet another rehosting.<p><p><B>Phase 3 - Relocation and merger</B><br>The final step in this long journey came in March 2012, when the Board of Directorsof the Guild terminated the author's volunteered support of the Guild Website.&nbsp;That necessitated relocation of the technical information which had been attachedto that Website since its beginning.&nbsp;<p>The serendipity of these two relocation requirements prompted merger of the twoformerly separate Web publications into one.&nbsp;Since commercial Web hosting has become relatively inexpensive,one such service was selected to provide what was hoped would be a permanent homefor this online publication.&nbsp;Since the site data pages are produced from the same database, it took very littleeffort to combine the two sets of information onto one Website.&nbsp;Considerable reworking of some of the general text pages was done immediatelyfollowing the merger, in order to integrate the two sections more fully.&nbsp;Some additional work remained to be done in that direction,and was accomplished on an incremental basis.<p><p><B>Phase 4 - Relocation yet again</B><br>In January 2015, the Website was relocated to a different hosting company(HostMySite), where it remains.&nbsp;See the <A HREF="WhatWasNew2015.html">news for 2015</A> for details.<p><p><B>Phase 5 - Radical revision of the maintenance process</B><br>In June 2021, a major change in the process of maintaining the pages for this Websitetook place, and is described on a <a href="data/maintenance.html">new pageabout maintenance</a>.&nbsp;But there was no change of hosting company.<p><hr><p><p><B>Footnote on database history</B><br>As indicated in the Background above, this Website depends heavily on an underlyingdatabase, which was initially developed from non-computerized information.&nbsp;Most characteristics of the first computerized version, developed in the late 1960s,are still recognizable in today's version, but there have been additions alongthe way.&nbsp;One of the first additions, in July 1975, was to record the date when anew instrument was added to the database.&nbsp;Analysis of this information yields the following graph showing how the number of sitesin the database increased over time.<img src="graphics/SitesAdded1975-2022.png" alt="graph of sites in the database">The most notable increase occurred in 1992, following receipt of a large amount of dataon American chimes, which had been collected by Frank Della Penna,plus an Eijsbouts listing of all of their carillons and chimes up to 1991.&nbsp;<p>Unfortunately, there is no simple way to produce a similar graph of the number of sitesfrom the data base which had pages on the the GCNA and TowerBells Websites.&nbsp;However, a few markers along the way can be reported, based on entries from historialWhat's New pages:<UL>	<LI>Jan.1997:&nbsp; Construction of the data section of the GCNA Website began.	<LI>Mar.1997:&nbsp; Site data pages for all North American traditional carillons exist.	<LI>Aug.1999:&nbsp; 240 site data pages include all North American 		non-traditional carillons.	<LI>2001-2: &nbsp; Adding pages for North American chimes and rings to GCNA Website.	<LI>2000-2014:&nbsp; Notice from the graph above that new sites were added to the		database every year.&nbsp;		All of these sites would have been added to the appropriate Website immediately.	<LI>Mar.2012:&nbsp; Relocation and merger (see Phase 3 above).	<LI>May 2022:&nbsp; It is finally possible to say that all sites in the database		have pages on the Website.	</UL><p><hr><p><A HREF="TowerBells.html">[Tower Bells Introduction]</A><A HREF="WebsiteMap.html">[Website Map]</A><A HREF="CSZ.html">[The builder]</A><A HREF="WhatIsNew.html">[What's New]</A><p><small>This page was created on 2012/04/25 and last revised on 2022/07/12.</small><p><small>Please send comments or questions (either general or about this page) to<A HREF="mailto:csz_stl@swbell.net?subject=Comments%20on%20WebsiteHistory">theWebmaster/owner</A>.<br>Use similar links on other pages to send specific comments or questions about those pages.</small></p></div></body></html>
