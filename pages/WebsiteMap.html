			<h1>Website Map</h1>
			<p>
				Elsewhere on the World Wide Web (colloquially called the Web), a page like this would be 
				called a "site map."&nbsp; Here it's called a "Website map" because we use the word "site" 
				to mean the location of a tower bell instrument of some kind.&nbsp; That is most commonly 
				seen in the term "site data page", which is a page (on this Website) that identifies, locates 
				and describes one particular tower bell instrument or collection.
			</p>
			<p>
				This map covers only the topmost part of this Website, which is only a small portion of the total.&nbsp;
				For the contents of the rest, see the Data Top page referenced in this map.&nbsp; See also the 
				<a href="#NavTips">Navigation Tips</a> below.

								Introduction to, and Contents of, site data pages about carillons, chimes,
								rings, etc., together with index pages and regional locator maps to find them.&nbsp;
								All known instruments or collections of 8 or more tower bells (whether conventional,
								hemispherical, tubular or porcelain) are included, except as otherwise noted.&nbsp;
								Over 3500 pages are directly or indirectly dependent from this one.&nbsp;
								<!-- As of 25 Jul 2012: 2376 site data + 280 index + 50 index lists + ? others -->
								<!-- As of 20 Nov 2018: 2616 site data + 296 index + 49 index lists + 60+ others -->
								<!-- As of 30 Jul 2020: 3186 site data + 296 index + 49 index lists + 60+ others -->
								These are hierarchically arranged as follows:
							</p>
							
							<OL>
								<li>
									Index lists, linked from the Data Top page:<br/>
									<ul>
										<li>
											Five area index lists each present a group of type index lists
											for one particular continental region
											plus a group of area indexes, maps and lists for that region.
										</li>
										<li>
											Four type index lists each present all of the area index lists
											for one particular type of instrument (such as traditional carillons);
											each area may cover a single country or an entire continental region.
										</li>
										<li>
											Each area or type index list presents a group of index pages
											for a specific geographic area of the world (a continent or a country)
											and/or for a specific type of instrument (such as traditional carillons).
										</li>
									</ul>
									<li>
										Each index page under any index list points into a set of site data pages, 
										each describing one of the tower bell instruments which are known or presumed 
										to be extant within the scope of that index.&nbsp; Under any particular index list, 
										each of the index pages lists that set of site data pages in a different sequence,
										depending on the nature of the index.
									</li>
									<li>
										From each such site data page the following can be reached:
										<ul>
											<li>
												a description of the <A HREF="data/Std_format.html">standard format</A>
												of such pages
											</li>
											<li>
												an explanation of how we present <A HREF="data/KeybdRange.html">keyboard range</A>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
										Foundry index pages not only point to site data pages but also point into regional 
										lists of great bells as well as into regional pages about sites that are no more.
									</li>
									<li>
										Site data pages also have reverse links to the places within index pages from which 
										they are forward-linked.
									</li>
								</li>
							</OL>
								
							<p>
								Great bells that are not part of listed tower bell instruments (i.e., that are "independent") 
								do not have site data pages; instead, each one has a numbered section in a page for its geographic region.
							</p>
							<p>
								Supporting pages on various topics are listed in the <A HREF="data/Data_Top.html#contents">Contents section</A> 
								of the Data Top page.

			<h2 id="NavTips">Tips on Navigating This Website</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Every page outside the Data section has a navigation bar at the top (as this one 
					does), showing one possible hierarchical path between the home page and the current 
					page.&nbsp; That bar has links back to the preceding pages on that path.&nbsp;
					(Obviously the home page has no need of such a navigation bar.)
				</li>
				<li>
					Every page except the home page has a 4-item menu bar near the bottom of the page 
					(as this one does), presenting links to a few useful pages that are not hierarchically 
					connected.&nbsp; The selection of items presented on such menu bars in the Data section 
					of this Website is different from the selection presented elsewhere.
				</li>
				<li>
					This Website Map page, together with the Contents portion of the Data Top page, shows all 
					major topic (i.e., non-data) pages in a hierarchical layout.
				</li>
				<li>
					Every site data page can be reached from several different index pages as well as from at 
					least one regional locator map.&nbsp; The Links section of each site data page contains 
					several back-links to the referencing lines of various such index pages (though not all).&nbsp;
					This structure enables finding any site based on a variety of criteria, as well as exploring 
					the relationships between any site and others that are similar to it.
				</li>
				<li>
					Index pages and other list pages within the Data section have a link near the bottom
					which goes back to the "index list" page for that particular set of related indexes.
				</li>
				<li>
					There are numerous cross-links between pages, as well as jump links within pages.&nbsp;
					Watch the status bar of your Web browser as you mouse over a link to foresee where it 
					will take you if you click it.
