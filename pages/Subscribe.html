			<h1>Subscribing to TowerBells Update Notices</h1>
		</header>

		<section>
			<h2>Why update notices?</h2>
			
			<p>
				This Website is updated as new information is found (or reported)
				or as old information is discovered to be incomplete or incorrect.&nbsp;
				Thus it changes frequently, and not simply by the addition of new material
				as some Websites do.&nbsp;
				Since the first of these site data pages appeared on the Web in early 1997,
				it has been the policy to send update notices to all eddresses (email addresses)
				which appear in a batch of such newly added or revised pages.&nbsp;
				These notices serve two purposes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					They enable people who have submitted information about their own
					tower bell instruments to verify that such information has been 
					correctly posted to the Website.
				</li>
				<li>
					They tell people who have not submitted such information that Webpages
						about their instruments exist, thus alerting them to the advisability
						of verifying that whatever is being written about their instrument
						is accurate.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				The update notice subscription facility serves another purpose:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					It enables subscribers to discover new or revised information about
					tower bell instruments other than their own, 
					as promptly as if a Google Alert were used,
					though Google Alerts can't monitor specific Websites.
				</li>
			</ul>
				
			<p>
				While the site data pages for instruments made of conventional bells were part
				of the GCNA Website, update notices were automatically copied to all members of
				the committee which had oversight of that Website.&nbsp;
				That automatic service was terminated when those pages were
				moved to this Website in April 2012.
			</p>
					
			<p>
				All copies of update notices are sent with blind addressing (BCC), to eliminate the
				risk of eddress harvesting by malware on a recipient's computer.
			</p>

			<h2>How to subscribe</h2>
			
			<p>
				It's very simple&nbsp; -&nbsp; just 
				<A HREF="mailto:csz_stl@swbell.net?subject=Subscribe%20to%20update%20notices">send
				an email</A> to the Webmaster/owner.&nbsp; Using the link in the preceding sentence 
				will pre-set the subject of an email message appropriately.&nbsp; It would be helpful 
				if you used the body of the message to explain your interest in tower bells,
				especially which of the following fields of interest best fits you:
			</p>
			<UL>
				<LI>traditional carillons only,</LI>
				<LI>all instruments made of conventional bells
					<br>(including traditional carillons),
				</LI>
				<LI>all instruments made of tubular bells,</LI>
				<LI>all types of tower bell instruments.</LI>
			</UL>
			
			<p>
				If you do not specify a field of interest, 
				I will assume that your interest is in all types of instruments.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you are added to the appropriate subscription list, you will receive a copy
				of each Website update notice for which the new or revised site data pages 
				include instruments in your field of interest.&nbsp;
				(Such notices may also include instruments outside your field of interest.)&nbsp;
				If you wonder (or worry) how often that might be, look at the dates in the 
				<a href="WhatsNew/WhatIsNew.html">What's New page</a>.&nbsp;
				Only those updates which explicitly include site data pages will trigger
				the sending of update notices, and each notice will tell you precisely how to find
				those site data pages that were added or revised.&nbsp;
				But it will not tell you what was changed within each page.
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h2>How to unsubscribe</h2>
			
			<p>
				It's very simple&nbsp; -&nbsp; just reply to any update notice, 
				adding the word UNSUBSCRIBE to the end
				of the subject line of the message.&nbsp;
				You don't need to explain anything!
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Unlike other email subscriptions, there are no subscribe/unsubscribe
				instructions in the update notices themselves.&nbsp;
				That is because their primary addressees are the people or offices
				who are identified on the new or revised site data pages, 
				and they do not have the option to unsubscribe
				except by requesting removal of their names (or at least eddresses)
				from those pages.&nbsp;
				Their "subscriptions" are not like yours would be, because they will receive
				update notices only when the site data pages for their own instruments are
				added or changed.
			</p>
		</section>
		
		<section>
			<h2>An alternative to subscribing</h2>
			
			<p>
				If you have a tool or method for monitoring changed Webpages,
				the only page that you need to monitor on this Website
				is the <a href="WhatsNew/WhatIsNew.html">What's New page</a>,
				because it will always point to all other changed pages,
				either directly or via an update index page.
