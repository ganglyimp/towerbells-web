			<h1>Subscribing to TowerBells Update Notices</h1>
		</header>

		<section>
			<h2>Why update notices?</h2>

			<p>
				This Website is updated as new information is found (or reported) or as old information is discovered to
				be incomplete or incorrect.&nbsp; Thus it changes frequently, and not simply by the addition of new
				material as some Websites do.&nbsp; Since the first of these site data pages appeared on the Web in
				early 1997, it has been the policy to send update notices to all eddresses (email addresses) which
				appear in a batch of such newly added or revised pages.&nbsp; These notices serve two purposes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					They enable people who have submitted information about their own tower bell instruments to verify
					that such information has been correctly posted to the Website.
				</li>
				<li>
					They tell people who have not submitted such information that Webpages about their instruments
					exist, thus alerting them to the advisability of verifying that whatever is being written about
					their instrument is accurate.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The update notice subscription facility serves another purpose:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					It enables subscribers to discover new or revised information about tower bell instruments other
					than their own, as promptly as if a Google Alert were used, though Google Alerts can't monitor
					specific Websites.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				While the site data pages for instruments made of conventional bells were part of the GCNA Website,
				update notices were automatically copied to all members of the committee which had oversight of that
				Website.&nbsp; That automatic service was terminated when those pages were moved to this Website in
				April 2012.
			</p>

			<p>
				All copies of update notices are sent with blind addressing (BCC), to eliminate the risk of email
				address harvesting by malware on a recipient's computer.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>How to subscribe</h2>

			<p>
				It's very simple&nbsp; -&nbsp; just
				<a href="mailto:csz_stl@swbell.net?subject=Subscribe%20to%20update%20notices">
					send an email
				</a>
				to the Webmaster/owner.&nbsp; Using the link in the preceding sentence will pre-set the subject of an
				email message appropriately.&nbsp; It would be helpful if you used the body of the message to explain
				your interest in tower bells, especially which of the following fields of interest best fits you:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>traditional carillons only</li>
				<li>
					all instruments made of conventional bells <br />
					(including traditional carillons)
				</li>
				<li>all instruments made of tubular bells</li>
				<li>all types of tower bell instruments</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				If you do not specify a field of interest, I will assume that your interest is in all types of
				instruments.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you are added to the appropriate subscription list, you will receive a copy of each Website update
				notice for which the new or revised site data pages include instruments in your field of interest.&nbsp;
				(Such notices may also include instruments outside your field of interest.)&nbsp; If you wonder (or
				worry) how often that might be, look at the dates in the
				<a href="/pages/WhatsNew/WhatIsNew.html">What's New page</a>.&nbsp;
				Only those updates which explicitly include site data pages will trigger the sending of update notices,
				and each notice will tell you precisely how to find those site data pages that were added or
				revised.&nbsp; But it will not tell you what was changed within each page.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>How to unsubscribe</h2>

			<p>
				It's very simple&nbsp; -&nbsp; just reply to any update notice, adding the word UNSUBSCRIBE to the end
				of the subject line of the message.&nbsp; You don't need to explain anything!
			</p>

			<p>
				Unlike other email subscriptions, there are no subscribe/unsubscribe instructions in the update notices
				themselves.&nbsp; That is because their primary addressees are the people or offices who are identified
				on the new or revised site data pages, and they do not have the option to unsubscribe except by
				requesting removal of their names (or at least email addresses) from those pages.&nbsp; Their
				"subscriptions" are not like yours would be, because they will receive update notices only when the site
				data pages for their own instruments are added or changed.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>An alternative to subscribing</h2>

			<p>
				If you have a tool or method for monitoring changed Webpages, the only page that you need to monitor on
				this Website is the <a href="/pages/WhatsNew/WhatIsNew.html">What's New page</a>, because it will always
				point to all other changed pages, either directly or via an update index page.
