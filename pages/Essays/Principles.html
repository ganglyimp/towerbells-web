			<H1>Principles for Living Well</H1>

			<p>
				Using a few simple principles when deciding what to do (or not do) in your life can make a big 
				difference in how much you enjoy life.&nbsp; Or to put it another way, following a few simple 
				guidelines can help you stay on course in the pursuit of happiness.&nbsp; In no particular order, 
				here are some I've found helpful:
			</p>
		</header>

		<section>
			<UL>
				<LI>
					<B>Don't make life difficult for yourself.</B>
					<p>Be smart lazy, not stupid lazy.</p>
					<p>
						If the option that looks easy now will cause you more work later, then it's not really as 
						easy as it looks.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>If a minute's work now will save you two minutes of work tomorrow, then do it now.</p>
					<p>If you don't have time to do it right, how will you find time to do it over again?</p>
					<p>Habits are useful, until they aren't.</p>
					<p>
						Always think about what you are doing, because what was the best way yesterday may not be the best 
						way today.
					</p>
				</LI>

				<br />
			
				<LI>
					<B>Making someone else's life worse won't make yours better.</B>
					<p>If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.</p>
				</LI>
				
				<br />

				<LI>
					<B>The quick, easy answer is usually wrong.</B>
					<p>
						Why?&nbsp; Because it almost certainly ignores the multiplicity of complications that keep 
						life from being boring.
					</p>
					<p>Personal anecdotes make good sob stories but bad law.</p>
				</LI>

				<br />
			
				<LI>
					<B>Love takes work; but it's worth the effort.</B>
					<p>
						The amount of love you have to give is not limited by anything except the narrowness of 
						your vision.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>You can't love your neighbor as yourself if you don't love yourself.</p>
					<p>Love is not desire, though love and desire go hand-in-hand in a good marriage.</p>
				</LI>
			
				<br />

				<LI>
					<B>Be trustworthy.</B>
					<p>Otherwise you have no grounds for trusting anyone else.</p>
					<p>
						One way to measure the success of a society is the degree to which its members can trust 
						each other, and especially their leaders, to follow the rules that define the society.&nbsp;
						This holds true whether the society is as small as a bridge club or as large as a nation, 
						and whether the rules are written or unwritten.
					</p>
					<p>
						Distrust can only produce misery, whether you are the distrustor or the distrustee.
					</p>
				</LI>

				<br />
			
				<LI>
					<B>Know yourself.</B>
					<p>
						Utilize your strengths and avoid putting excessive demands on your weaknesses; otherwise 
						you set yourself up for failure and unhappiness.
					</p>
					<p>
						Your interests may change, but your aptitudes won't.&nbsp; A person who trains up to the 
						limit of a weak aptitude may perform better than an untrained person in whom that aptitude 
						is strong; but given equal training, the person with a strong aptitude will always perform better.
					</p>
				</LI>

				<br />
			
				<LI>
					<B>Know the world in which we live.</B>
					<p>
						Understanding both the usefulness and the limitations of science is essential to efficient and 
						effective living.
					</p>
					<p>
						A belief that is contrary to fact is a delusion, no matter how sincerely it may be held.
					</p>
				</LI>

				<br />
			
				<LI>
					<B>Religion is worthwhile,</B>
					<p>
						... but only if you choose to follow the right one.&nbsp; A religion that is inconsistent with 
						the realities of the world in which we live makes life worse, not better.
					</p>
					<p>
						An atheist has no grounds for claiming to be anything more than a talking animal, in spite of 
						being at the top of the evolutionary tree.
