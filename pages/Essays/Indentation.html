               <h1>On Indentation as a Reflection of Logical Structure</h1>
               <p>
                    It is common in many kinds of writing to use varying amounts of indentation to give 
                    a visual representation of some underlying structure for what is being written.&nbsp;
                    This is particularly true in many of the specialized languages that are used
                    to program computers, even when the language processor does not require (or even recognize) 
                    indentation as having any effect on the interpretation of the language.&nbsp; Arranging the 
                    pieces of a computer program according to a systematic method of indentation helps the 
                    programmer to visualize the logical relationships between those pieces.&nbsp; Such a habit is 
                    so useful that there are even programming tools that can assist a programmer in this effort.&nbsp;
                    So let's take a look at how this might work in practice.
               </p>
          </header>

          <section>
               <p>
                    As an example, we might write in English,
                    "<code>
                         If a certain condition is true, then do one thing; otherwise do something else.
                    </code>"
                    &nbsp; (Of course in reality we would use a lot more words to describe just what the condition was, 
                    what the "one thing" was, and what the "something else" was.&nbsp; But for the purposes of this example 
                    we don't need to do that.)&nbsp; Now if we want to use indentation to visualize that logical statement,
                    we could do it this way:
               </p>
               <pre>
               If a certain condition is true, then
                    do one thing;
               otherwise
                    do something else.
               </pre>
               <p>
                    That's pretty straightforward, and there really isn't any other way to do it.&nbsp; While it is of 
                    course possible to vary the amount of indentation, consistency of indentation is essential to maintain 
                    the clarity of the logical structure.
               </p>
               <p>
                    In reality, things don't happen in isolation; some preparation is needed beforehand, and some finishing 
                    work afterward.&nbsp; Furthermore, now that we're using indentation, we don't really need to follow the 
                    capitalization and punctuation rules that apply to writing plain text.&nbsp; So perhaps it might look 
                    like this:
               </p>
               <pre>
               do some preparation
               if a certain condition is true then
                    do one thing
               otherwise
                    do something else
               finish with some cleanup work
               </pre>
               <p>
                    We should also mention that the "otherwise" clause is always optional, so it's possible to have just this:
               </p>
               <pre>
               do some preparation
               if a certain condition is true then
                    do something
               finish with some cleanup work
               </pre>
               <p>
                    Either way, this demonstrates one of the characteristics of indentation methods, namely that all the things 
                    that share a common level of indentation happen sequentially.&nbsp; In the longer example above, that means 
                    first (#1) do some preparation, next (#2) do either one thing or another thing, and finally (#3) finish. 
               </p>
               <p>
                    Actually, we've also just demonstrated a common characteristic of many programming languages - each line is 
                    a separate statement.&nbsp; So if the two logical branches involved more extensive work, we might have this:
               </p>
               <pre>
               do some preparation
               if a certain condition is true then
                    do one thing
                    do a second thing
               otherwise
                    do another thing
                    do yet another thing
               finish with some cleanup work
               </pre>
               <p>
                    This illustrates that within the mainline sequence set out above, each of the logical alternatives is a 
                    subordinate sequence, and only one of those subordinate sequences will be performed.
               </p>
               <p>
                    But while that makes logical sense to you, dear reader, it wouldn't make sense in a programming language 
                    unless that language explicitly recognized indentation as our eyes do.&nbsp; I know of only one such language 
                    (JOVIAL); the vast majority of programming languages require either keywords or special punctuation to delineate 
                    the logical structure of a program.
               </p>
               <p>
                    In a keyword language (such as FORTRAN), the same assertion of logical alternatives might look something like this:
               </p>
               <pre>
               IF condition THEN statement_1 ELSE statement_2
               </pre>
               <p>
                    and if you needed to do more complicated work, then a statement could be replaced with a block of statements 
                    like this:
               </p>
               <pre>
               IF condition THEN BEGIN
                    statement_1
                    statement_2
                    END
               ELSE statement_3
               </pre>
               <p>
                    (If you don't like the indentation on that END statement, just take a deep breath and keep going - we'll get 
                    back to that in a moment.)
               </p>
               <p>
                    In a punctuated language (such as Pascal or Javascript), the same logical assertion  might look something 
                    like this:
               </p>
               <pre>
               IF (condition) {statement1} ELSE {statement2}
               </pre>
               <p>
                    and if you needed to do more complicated work, then multiple statements could be placed within the curly 
                    brackets like this:
               </p>
               <pre>
               IF (condition) {statement_1;statement_2} ELSE {statement_3}
               </pre>
               <p> 
                    It's when we consider how to convert such logical assertions into indented displays that we encounter
                    the dichotomy that prompted the writing of this essay.&nbsp; It was hinted at in the parenthesized sentence 
                    just above, and it has to do with how far the terminating keyword or punctuation of a block of
                    statements should be indented.&nbsp; There are two possibilities, as follows:
               </p>
               <pre>
               IF (condition) {
                    statement_1;statement_2
                    }
               ELSE {
                    statement_3
                    }
               </pre>
               <p>or</p>
               <pre>
               IF (condition) {
                    statement_1;statement_2
               }
               ELSE {
                    statement_3
               }
               </pre>
               <p>
                    Not surprisingly, there are two schools of thought about this in the world of programmers, one holding 
                    that the first form is the only one that makes sense, and the other making the same claim about the 
                    second form.&nbsp; Let's restate these possibilities in a keyword language and add some context:
               </p>
               <pre>
               preceding statements
               IF condition THEN BEGIN
                    statement_1
                    statement_2
                    END
               ELSE statement_3
               following statements
               </pre>
               <p>or</p>
               <pre>
               preceding statements
               IF condition THEN BEGIN
                    statement_1
                    statement_2
               END
               ELSE statement_3
               following statements
               </pre>
               <p>
                    For those who favor the second form, perhaps they would argue that the END isn't part of the 
                    conditional block, but rather part of the frame for the executable statements that make up the block.
               </p>
               <p>
                    But to my mind, the un-indented END in the second form is just getting in the way, pretending to be an 
                    executable statement following the IF while obscuring the presence of the optional ELSE clause.&nbsp;
                    After all, the END isn't needed by the human reader; it's needed by the computer language processor, 
                    which doesn't care about indentation.&nbsp; For the human reader, the indentation pattern itself carries 
                    all the necessary information about the logical structure, and it's important to see immediately that the 
                    optional ELSE clause is indeed present.&nbsp; Therefore it's better to present the END as being the last 
                    line of block which it terminates.
               </p>
               <p>
               Similar logic applies to the question of how to indent the closure of a repetition block:
               </p>
               <pre>
               preliminary work
               loop under some control
                    work inside the loop
                    end marker for the loop
               next thing after the loop
               </pre>
               <p>not this:</p>
               <pre>
               preliminary work
               loop under some control
                    work inside the loop
               end marker for the loop
               next thing after the loop
               </pre>
               <p>
                    So now you know my opinion on the subject.&nbsp; If you disagree, please use the email link at the bottom of 
                    this page to tell me your reason(s).
               </p>
               <p>
                    By the way, this is NOT a trivial matter, because it significantly affects the readability, and therefore the 
                    maintainability, of computer programs and Webpages.
