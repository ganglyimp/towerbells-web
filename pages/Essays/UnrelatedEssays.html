			<H1>Topics Unrelated to the Rest of TowerBells</H1>

			<p>
				Anyone who has survived in this world for four-fifths of a century ought to have some potentially useful
				thoughts to share with other passengers on Planet Earth.&nbsp; Here are a few of mine, each in the form
				of an essay on a subject.&nbsp; Some of them truly are totally unrelated to the purpose of the main body
				of the TowerBells Website.&nbsp; Others are peripherally related, in that they were prompted by things
				that happened in the course of development of that Website, which now spans over 20 years (or 23 years,
				or 45 years, or 63 years, <!-- as of Feb.2020 --> depending on what's taken as the starting point for
				its contents and organization).
