<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Topics unrelated to the rest of TowerBells.org</H1>
<p>
Anyone who has survived in this world for four-fifths of a century
ought to have some potentially useful thoughts to share with other 
passengers on Planet Earth.&nbsp;
Here are a few of mine, each in the form of an essay on a subject.&nbsp;
Some of them truly are totally unrelated to the purpose of the main body
of the TowerBells Website.&nbsp;
Others are peripherally related, in that they were prompted by things that
happened in the course of development of that Website, 
which now spans over 20 years (or 23 years, or 45 years, or 63 years,
<!-- as of Feb.2020 -->depending on what's taken as the starting point 
for its contents and organization).
