			<H1>Topics Unrelated to the Rest of TowerBells</H1>

			<p>
				Anyone who has survived in this world for four-fifths of a century ought to have 
				some potentially useful thoughts to share with other passengers on Planet Earth.&nbsp;
				Here are a few of mine, each in the form of an essay on a subject.&nbsp; Some of them 
				truly are totally unrelated to the purpose of the main body of the TowerBells Website.&nbsp;
				Others are peripherally related, in that they were prompted by things that happened in the 
				course of development of that Website, which now spans over 20 years (or 23 years, or 45 years, 
				or 63 years, <!-- as of Feb.2020 -->depending on what's taken as the starting point for its contents 
				and organization).
