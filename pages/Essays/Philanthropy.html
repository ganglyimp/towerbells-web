<p>
If you've recently won a big lottery, or otherwise have wealth to give away,
here are some ways to put that money to good use in the world of bells,
brightening the auditory environment for everyone nearby.&nbsp;
Projects listed in geographic regions are associated with existing tower bell installations,
and are linked to the relevant site data page on this Website.&nbsp;
Projects listed in the General category are less well defined,
and will require more investigation on your part.
