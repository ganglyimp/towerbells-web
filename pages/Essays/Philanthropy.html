				If you've recently won a big lottery, or otherwise have wealth to give away, here are some ways 
				to put that money to good use in the world of bells, brightening the auditory environment for 
				everyone nearby.&nbsp; Projects listed in geographic regions are associated with existing tower 
				bell installations, and are linked to the relevant site data page on this Website.&nbsp; Projects 
				listed in the General category are less well defined, and will require more investigation on your part.
