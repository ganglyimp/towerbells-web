				If you've recently won a big lottery, or otherwise have wealth to give away, here are some ways to put
				that money to good use in the world of bells, brightening the auditory environment for everyone
				nearby.&nbsp; Projects listed in geographic regions are associated with existing tower bell
				installations, and are linked to the relevant site data page on this Website.&nbsp; Projects listed in
				the General category are less well defined, and will require more investigation on your part.
