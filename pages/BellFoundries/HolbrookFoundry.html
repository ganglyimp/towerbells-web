			<h1>Holbrook Bells and Bellfoundries</h1>
			<p>
				George Holbrook was perhaps the third major bellfounder in America, after Aaron Hobart and Paul Revere.&nbsp;

			<h2>Extant Bells by George Holbrook</h2>
			<p>
				This section presents links to Webpages which mention bells cast by George Holbrook and his descendants.&nbsp;
				They are listed in approximate chronological order, and grouped according to the changes in the name, the location 
				and/or the proprietorship of the business.&nbsp; (There are gaps in the dates because the chronology given here is 
				based mainly on the inscriptions of dated surviving Holbrook bells.)&nbsp; Actual inscriptions are shown in 
				<B>boldface type</B> when known.
			</p>

			<h3>Major George Holbrook, Brookfield, Massachusetts, 1797-1810</h3>
			<p>
				Born in 1767, George Holbrook was apprenticed to Paul Revere to learn the machinist's and clockmaker's trades.&nbsp;
				Presumably he returned to Revere's employ after earning his rank in the Revolutionary War, because it was not until 
				1797 that he set up an establishment of his own, in this town.&nbsp; (At the age Holbrook would have been when Revere 
				cast his first bell, in 1792, his apprenticeship would long since have been completed.)

			</UL>

			<h3>Major George Holbrook, Medway, Massachusetts, 1816-1820</h3>
			<p>
				Holbrook left Brookfield after financial reverses, setling in East Medway after winning a contract to cast a bell for 
				the new meeting house there in 1816.

			<h3>George H. Holbrook, Medway, Massachusetts, 1820-1828</h3>
			<p>
				Major Holbrook's son, George Handel Holbrook (later Col. Holbrook), took over the bellfoundry business from his father 
				in 1820, and carried it on until shortly before his death in 1875.

				Upon the death of George H. Holbrook, he was succeeded in the bell business by his grandson, Edwin Handel Holbrook, who had 
				been involved with it since 1868.&nbsp; E.H.Holbrook sold this firm in 1880, and went into other work.

			<p>
				East Medway was incorporated into the town of Millis in 1885.&nbsp; The town

				<A HREF="http://www.millis.org/history/Holbrook%20Factories/HolbrookBells.htm">history  of the Holbrook factories and bells</A>, 
				but it seems to have disappeared (perhaps by accident).
