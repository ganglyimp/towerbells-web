						George Holbrook was perhaps the third major bellfounder in America, after Aaron Hobart and Paul
						Revere.&nbsp; This page provides some information about Holbrook's work and Holbrook bells.
					</p>
					<p>
						Note that this page is not located among those in the /data/ section of this Website.&nbsp; That
						is because the Holbrooks, like the Reveres, never made any chimes, and apparently made only one
						peal (of just two bells!).

					<h1 id="extant-bells">Extant Bells by George Holbrook</h1>
					<p>
						This section presents links to Webpages which mention bells cast by George Holbrook and his
						descendants.&nbsp; They are listed in approximate chronological order, and grouped according to
						the changes in the name, the location and/or the proprietorship of the business.&nbsp; (There
						are gaps in the dates because the chronology given here is based mainly on the inscriptions of
						dated surviving Holbrook bells.)&nbsp; Actual inscriptions are shown in <b>boldface type</b>
						when known.
					</p>

					<h2 id="1797-1810">Major George Holbrook, Brookfield, Massachusetts, 1797-1810</h2>
					<p>
						Born in 1767, George Holbrook was apprenticed to Paul Revere to learn the machinist's and
						clockmaker's trades.&nbsp; That apprenticeship would long since have been completed by the time
						Revere cast his first bell, in 1792.&nbsp; Since it was not until 1797 that Holbrook set up an
						establishment of his own, in this town, it seems safe to presume that he learned the art of
						casting bells by returning to Revere's employ after earning his rank in the Revolutionary War.
					</p>

					</ul>

					<h2 id="1816-1820">Major George Holbrook, Medway, Massachusetts, 1816-1820</h2>
					<p>
						Holbrook left Brookfield after financial reverses, settling in East Medway after winning a
						contract to cast a bell for the new meeting house there in 1816.
					</p>
					<ul>

					</ul>

					<h2 id="1820-1828">George H. Holbrook, Medway, Massachusetts, 1820-1828</h2>
					<p>
						Major Holbrook's son, George Handel Holbrook (later Col. Holbrook), took over the bellfoundry
						business from his father in 1820, and carried it on until shortly before his death in 1875.

						Upon the death of George H. Holbrook, he was succeeded in the bell business by his grandson,
