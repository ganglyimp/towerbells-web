						George Holbrook was perhaps the third major bellfounder in America, after Aaron Hobart and Paul Revere.&nbsp;
						This page provides some information about Holbrook's work and Holbrook bells.
					</p>
					<p>
						Note that this page is not located among those in the /data/ section of this Website.&nbsp; That is because the 
						Holbrooks, like the Reveres, never made any chimes, and apparently made only one peal (of just two bells!).

					<p>
						This section presents links to Webpages which mention bells cast by George Holbrook and his descendants.&nbsp;
						They are listed in approximate chronological order, and grouped according to the changes in the name, the location 
						and/or the proprietorship of the business.&nbsp; (There are gaps in the dates because the chronology given here is 
						based mainly on the inscriptions of dated surviving Holbrook bells.)&nbsp; Actual inscriptions are shown in 
						<B>boldface type</B> when known.

					<h2 id="1797-1810">Major George Holbrook, Brookfield, Massachusetts, 1797-1810</h2>
					<p>
						Born in 1767, George Holbrook was apprenticed to Paul Revere to learn the machinist's and clockmaker's trades.&nbsp;
						That apprenticeship would long since have been completed by the time Revere cast his first bell, in 1792.&nbsp;
						Since it was not until 1797 that Holbrook set up an establishment of his own, in this town, it seems safe to presume 
						that he learned the art of casting bells by returning to Revere's employ after earning his rank in the Revolutionary War.

					<h2 id="1816-1820">Major George Holbrook, Medway, Massachusetts, 1816-1820</h2>
					<p>
						Holbrook left Brookfield after financial reverses, settling in East Medway after winning a contract to cast a bell for 
						the new meeting house there in 1816.

					<h2 id="1820-1828">George H. Holbrook, Medway, Massachusetts, 1820-1828</h2>
					<p>
						Major Holbrook's son, George Handel Holbrook (later Col. Holbrook), took over the bellfoundry business from his father 
						in 1820, and carried it on until shortly before his death in 1875.

						Upon the death of George H. Holbrook, he was succeeded in the bell business by his grandson, Edwin Handel Holbrook, who had 
						been involved with it since 1868.&nbsp; E.H.Holbrook sold this firm in 1880, and went into other work.
