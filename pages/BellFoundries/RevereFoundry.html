					<p>
						The famous patriot Paul Revere is also known as the second major bellfounder in America.&nbsp;
						(He was preceded by Col. Aaron Hobart of Abington [*], Massachusetts, and a handful of other
						colonial artisans who made small numbers of tower bells.)&nbsp; His definitive biography, the
						well-known "Paul Revere and the world he lived in", by Esther Forbes (Boston, Houghton Mifflin
						Company, 1942), describes his bell-making work on pages 385-391.
					</p>
					<p>
						*
						<small>
							The name of the town of Abington was mis-spelled as "Abingdon" on the proclamation which
							established it, and a few historic references use that spelling.
						</small>
					</p>
					<p>
						This page provides some information about Revere's work and Revere bells.
					</p>

				<section>
					<h1 id="extant-bells">Extant Bells by Paul Revere and Family</h1>
					<p>
						This section presents links to Webpages which mention surviving bells that were cast by Paul
						Revere, his sons or his grandsons.&nbsp; They are listed in approximate chronological order, and
						grouped according to the changes in the name and/or the proprietorship of the business.&nbsp;
						(There are gaps in the dates because the chronology given here is based partly on the
						inscriptions of dated surviving Revere bells.)&nbsp; Actual inscriptions are shown in boldface
						type when known.
					</p>

					<h2 id="1792-1798">Paul Revere, Boston, 1792-1798</h2>
					<p>
						Paul Revere's original bellfoundry was simply an extension of the iron and brass foundry which
						he had set up in Boston in 1787.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							In 1796, Revere sold a bell to the Town of Falmouth, MA.&nbsp; That is presumed to be the
							bell which is in the tower of
							<a href="http://www.firstcongfalmouth.org/">First Congregational Church</a> of Falmouth;
							see the History page.&nbsp; (There once was also an Organ page which carried more
							information about the bell, but it has been removed.)&nbsp; This bell is undated, and
							carries no maker's name, but its poetic inscription is the same as is found on other bells
							which do carry the Revere name, and its style is the same.
						</li>
						<li><i>(Six other bells survive from this period, but are not on the Web.)</i></li>
					</ul>

					<h2 id="1801">Revere & Sons, Boston, 1801</h2>
					<p>
						At least two of Paul Revere's 16 children, Paul Jr. and Joseph, entered their father's business.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><i>(Three bells survive from this period, but none are on the Web.)</i></li>
					</ul>

					<h2 id="1801-1811">Revere & Sons, Boston, 1801-1811</h2>
					<p>
						After a short time, Paul Jr. left his father's employ.&nbsp; (It is said that he went to work
						for bellfounder George Holbrook, but that has not been confirmed.)&nbsp; Joseph Revere stayed on
						with his father, as a junior partner in the business.&nbsp; In this same year, Revere set up the
						first copper rolling mill in America, in Canton.&nbsp; In 1804, the foundry was moved from
						Boston to Canton (though the bells continued to be labelled "Boston"), and Joseph made a trip to
						Europe to study bell-casting.

						On the death of Thomas Eayres Jr in 1818, Paul 3rd sold his share to Joseph, thus leaving the

						Hooper.)&nbsp; The name of the firm remain unchanged, even though Paul Sr had also died in
						1818.&nbsp; The last bell entry in the Revere stockbooks was dated 1828, though bells made after
						1824 did not carry a date on them.

					<h1 id="recast-bells">Recast Revere Bells</h1>
					<p>
						When bells are cracked through misuse, damaged by fire, or broken by other means, they are often
						recast using the original metal (usually with additions).&nbsp; This establishes a historical
						connection to the original bell, although the result cannot properly be attributed to the
						original bellfounder.&nbsp; The following bells are documented recastings of former Revere
						bells.

							Warren, RI,
							<a href="http://www.netsense.net/~rickwill/Warren/Site15.html">Baptist Church</a>; "Paul
							Revere's 13th bell" (1800?), recast by Meneely &amp; Co., West Troy, NY, and hung in Meneely
							fittings.&nbsp;

						</li>
						<li>
							North Boston, MA, <a href="graphics/StStephenBostonChurchbell.jpg">St.Stephen's Church</a>
							has a bell reputed to be by Revere.&nbsp; However, the style of the bell, yoke and uprights
							indicate that it is probably a recasting by Hooper or Blake.&nbsp; (The wheel is a modern
							replacement.)
