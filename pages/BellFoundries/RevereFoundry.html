					<p>
						The famous patriot Paul Revere is also known as the second major bellfounder in America.&nbsp; (He was preceded 
						by Col. Aaron Hobart of Abington [*], Massachusetts, and a handful of other colonial artisans who made small 
						numbers of tower bells.)&nbsp; His definitive biography, the well-known "Paul Revere and the world he lived in", 
						by Esther Forbes (Boston, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1942), describes his bell-making work on pages 385-391.
					</p>
					<p>
						* <small>The name of the town of Abington was mis-spelled as "Abingdon" on the proclamation which established it, 
						and a few historic references use that spelling.</small>
					</p>
					<p>
						This page provides some information about Revere's work and Revere bells.

					<h1 id="extant-bells">Extant Bells by Paul Revere and Family</h1>
					<p>
						This section presents links to Webpages which mention surviving bells that were cast by Paul Revere, his sons or his 
						grandsons.&nbsp; They are listed in approximate chronological order, and grouped according to the changes in the name 
						and/or the proprietorship of the business.&nbsp; (There are gaps in the dates because the chronology given here is 
						based partly on the inscriptions of dated surviving Revere bells.)&nbsp; Actual inscriptions are shown in boldface type 
						when known.
					</p>

					<h2 id="1792-1798">Paul Revere, Boston, 1792-1798</h2>
					<p>
						Paul Revere's original bellfoundry was simply an extension of the iron and brass foundry which he had set up in Boston 
						in 1787.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<LI>
							In 1796, Revere sold a bell to the Town of Falmouth, MA.&nbsp; That is presumed to be the bell which is in the tower 
							of <A HREF="http://www.firstcongfalmouth.org/">First Congregational Church</A> of Falmouth; see the History page.&nbsp;
							(There once was also an Organ page which carried more information about the bell, but it has been removed.)&nbsp; This 
							bell is undated, and carries no maker's name, but its poetic inscription is the same as is found on other bells which 
							do carry the Revere name, and its style is the same.
						</LI>
						<LI><I>(Six other bells survive from this period, but are not on the Web.)</I></LI>
					</ul>

					<h2 id="1801">Revere & Sons, Boston, 1801</h2>
					<p>
						At least two of Paul Revere's 16 children, Paul Jr. and Joseph, entered their father's business.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><I>(Three bells survive from this period, but none are on the Web.)</I></li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2 id="1801-1811">Revere & Sons, Boston, 1801-1811</h2>
					<p>
						After a short time, Paul Jr. left his father's employ.&nbsp; (It is said that he went to work for bellfounder George 
						Holbrook, but that has not been confirmed.)&nbsp; Joseph Revere stayed on with his father, as a junior partner in the 
						business.&nbsp; In this same year, Revere set up the first copper rolling mill in America, in Canton.&nbsp; In 1804, 
						the foundry was moved from Boston to Canton (though the bells continued to be labelled "Boston"), and Joseph made a 
						trip to Europe to study bell-casting.

						On the death of Thomas Eayres Jr in 1818, Paul 3rd sold his share to Joseph, thus leaving the latter as sole proprietor.&nbsp;
						(Paul 3rd later became a partner of bellfounder Henry N. Hooper.)&nbsp; The name of the firm remain unchanged, even though 
						Paul Sr had also died in 1818.&nbsp; The last bell entry in the Revere stockbooks was dated 1828, though bells made after 1824

					<h1 id="recast-bells">Recast Revere Bells</h1>
					<p>
						When bells are cracked through misuse, damaged by fire, or broken by other means, they are often recast using the original 
						metal (usually with additions).&nbsp; This establishes a historical connection to the original bell, although the result 
						cannot properly be attributed to the original bellfounder.&nbsp; The following bells are documented recastings of former 
						Revere bells.

							North Boston, MA, <A HREF="graphics/StStephenBostonChurchbell.jpg">St.Stephen's Church</A> has a bell reputed to be by 
							Revere.&nbsp; However, the style of the bell, yoke and uprights indicate that it is probably a recasting by Hooper or 
							Blake.&nbsp; (The wheel is a modern replacement.)
