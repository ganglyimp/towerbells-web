			<h1>Westport Methodist Church Bell Photos</h1>
			<p>
				Westport United Methodist Church, Kansas City, Missouri, has in its tower the only known bell made by
				Caughlan & Piquett (David Caughlan and David Piquett) of Saint Louis. Stylistically, both the bell and
				its fittings are very different from all later bells made by David Caughlan.
			</p>

				<figcaption>
					<p>
						The bell sits in the corner of a well-screened belfry. The two cast-iron support posts are
						bolted to the ends of a single foot timber which is fastened to the floor, and are held in
						position by brace rods which angle down to the left. There is no wheel; instead a lever is
						bolted vertically to the yoke, just off center. (This tends to corroborate the church's
						tradition that the bell came from a steamboat.) The bell rope is sloppily tied to the end of the
						lever, with the excess rope lying on the floor in the foreground. The rope runs through a large
						pulley block near the floor at left, and thence down to the ground floor of the tower. A long
						coil spring is also attached to the end of the lever, possibly to counter the weight of the bell
						rope.
					</p>
					<p>
						The red paint on the bell is ancient, and has faded or weathered away unevenly. Curiously, the
						fittings, which are much more susceptible to corrosion than the bell have never been painted.
						The white spots on the bell (and elsewhere) are splatters of paint from sloppy work on the
						belfry in the past.
					</p>

					<p>
						The yoke, here seen in profile, is tapered and recurved; the ends of the yoke form the gudgeons
						(bearing pins) and rest in open slots (with closed ends) in the tops of the support posts. The
						bell is supported by a single center bolt which passes through the body of the yoke; a support
						flange below the center of the yoke meets the flat top of the bell.
					</p>

				<img src="/images/Westport/Caughlan Westport 006.JPG" alt="Westport Photo 006" />

				<figcaption>
					<p>
						As above, showing all of the bell but less of the yoke.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is very little decoration on the bell - a shallow bead (barely seen in profile) on the top
						of the shoulder, a very heavy bead at the edge of the shoulder, a small bead below the waist
						(where the concave profile of the waist meets the convex profile of the soundbow), and a small
						step at the top of the straight lip.
					</p>
					<p>
						What here appears to be a shoulder band, more prominent on the left side than the right, is just
						the bottom edge of the inscription (which is shown in more detail below).
					</p>

				<img src="/images/Westport/Caughlan Westport 007.JPG" alt="Westport Photo 007" />

				<figcaption>
					<p>
						The cast iron support posts are very fancy. Instead of having an obvious straight post, they are
						formed with a long S-shaped curve, thickest in the middle, with the ends curled into circles
						around solid five-pointed stars. The bearing block is on top, and a foot plate (here invisible
						under the roofing material which floors the belfry) is on the bottom. The dangling excess rope
						and the brace rod behind the support post largely obscure the fact that there is additional
						ironwork between the upper circle and the middle of the S-curve to carry the vertical load.
					</p>

				<img src="/images/Westport/Caughlan Westport 020.JPG" alt="Westport Photo 020" />

				<figcaption>
					<p>
						The maker's inscription consists of three sections of lettering, side by side. In each section,
						there is one word in a straight line at the bottom, one or two words arched over the top, and
						either a space or a few characters in the middle.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here the center and right sections are visible, but most of the left section is obscured by the
						yoke.
					</p>
					<p>
						The following three photos show the sections more clearly, in order.
					</p>
				</figcaption>

			<figure class="flex-reversed">
				<img src="/images/Westport/Caughlan Westport 011.JPG" alt="Westport Photo 011" />

				<figcaption>
					<p>
						This photo shows the first (leftmost) section of the maker's inscription:
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">
						CAST BY <br />
						CAUGHLAN <br />
					</p>
					<p>
						There is an ampersand (&) after "Caughlan", almost hidden in the shadow of the yoke (see next
						photo).
					</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure class="flex-reversed">
				<img src="/images/Westport/Caughlan Westport 010.JPG" alt="Westport Photo 010" />

				<figcaption>
					<p>
						The center section of the maker's inscription:
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">
						S<small><sup>T</sup>..</small> Louis <br />
						M<small><sup>O</sup>..</small> <br />
						PIQUETT
					</p>
					<p>
						The T of the abbreviation for Saint is a small capital letter raised above a pair of periods
						(..). Similarly the O of the abbreviation for Missouri is a small capital letter standing on a
						dash (-) above a pair of periods (..).
					</p>
				</figcaption>

			<figure class="flex-reversed">
				<img src="/images/Westport/Caughlan Westport 008.JPG" alt="Westport Photo 008" />

				<figcaption>
					<p>
						The rightmost section of the maker's inscription:
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: center;">
						BELL & BRASS <BR />
						1853 <BR />
						FOUNDRY
					</p>
					<p>
						At the very top of the photo can be seen the cracked remains of a thin wooden pad between the
						top of the bell and the flange of the yoke. Such pads were often used by bellfounders, to
						compensate for irregularities in the metal surfaces or to absorb vibration or both.
					</p>

				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Side view, showing the positions of the brace rods and counter-spring more clearly. Even with
						the counter-spring, the weight of the rope is such that the bell does not hang straight when at
						rest. (A lighter rope would have been quite adequate for a bell of this size.)
