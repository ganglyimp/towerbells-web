			<h1>Caughlan Bells</h1>
			<p>
				This page provides some illustrative material related to the work of St.Louis bellfounder David
				Caughlan, who was active from about 1853 to 1866.&nbsp; It does not attempt to present a history of that
				bellfoundry, partly because the absence of dates on most of the surviving Caughlan bells makes that
				history problematical.&nbsp; However, a chronological outline of the business names which he used can be
				found on the <a href="/towerbells-web/pages/BellFoundries/StLouisBellFoundries.html#bf">Saint Louis Bellfoundries</a>
				page.
			</p>

		<section>
			<p>
				Here are four examples of bells by David Caughlan, plus a couple of others which have some stylistic
				connections.&nbsp; The photo links will open in separate browser windows to enable easy comparison of
				photo and text.&nbsp; All of the photos of one bell will share one browser window, which will be
				different from the windows used for other bells; this will enable easy comparison of different bells.

								One might speculate that the space in the middle was originally intended to be filled by
								"&amp; BRO", which would limit the range of dates within which this bell could have been
								made.&nbsp; However, there is also a longer space on the opposite side of the bell; if
								this space were filled then that one would be left alone, which leaves an odd asymmetry
								in the inscription.

							alternating acorns and small points dependent from the upper bead.

							style than that used on later bells.&nbsp; Notice that the "o" is elevated above a hyphen
							"-" and two periods.&nbsp;

				This bell is mounted on iron uprights, each of which is shaped from a single piece of heavy iron bar
				stock; they may be contemporary with the yoke.&nbsp; These uprights are in turn mounted on X-shaped
				wooden legs connected by a single crossbar.&nbsp; There are casters on the bottom to make the whole
				assembly movable.&nbsp; The skinny chain draped across the top is to prevent the uprights from spreading
				apart, and letting the bell fall.&nbsp; The bell assembly is stored in the basement of a very senior
				member of the Lodge; for the purpose of these photographs, it was rolled through a walkout door into the
				fortuitous sunshine.

							Showing bell, yoke and wheel.&nbsp; The decoration and lettering are typical of David
							Caughlan's larger bells. The yoke is similar to those on most of his bells; however, there
							is no sculpture on the center panel and no lettering on the faces of the arms, and the
							S-shape of the yoke reinforcement panels is much less tightly curved than that of the
							Pinckneyville yoke (above).&nbsp; The gudgeon pins are cast into the ends of the yoke.&nbsp;
							The wheel is not original--it does not fit the hub properly.

			<h2>Bells by Others</h2>

			<h3>Buckeye Bell Foundry, Cincinnati, O.</h3>

			<div class="grid-2-cols">
				<figure>
					<a href="/towerbells-web/images/Caughlan/Buckeye_08372_37m.jpg" target="BELL_B">
						<img class="clickable-block" src="/images/Caughlan/Buckeye_08372_37m.jpg" alt="Buckeye #1" />
					</a>
				</figure>

				<p>
					This bell is dated 1850, and is very similar to others from this foundry.&nbsp; The shoulder band is
					in three parts.&nbsp; The wide upper part is composed of six panels which alternate between
					lettering and sculpture.&nbsp; The middle part is a vine band, with 4-petaled open flowers above the
					vine and closed buds below it. The lower part is a repeated pattern of leaflets with smooth convex
					edges.&nbsp;
					<i>
						The middle and lower parts are virtually identical to those used on the California bell shown
						above, except that here they are more crisply molded.&nbsp; That might indicate that David
						Caughlan used a bell such as this as the pattern for his own decorative molds.
					</i>

			<h3>Mayer &amp; Ruppenthal, St.Louis, MO</h3>
			<div class="grid-2-cols">
				<figure>
					<a href="/towerbells-web/images/Caughlan/Mayer&Ruppenthal60857_33.jpg" target="BELL_MR">
						<img class="clickable-block" src="/images/Caughlan/Mayer&Ruppenthal60857_33.jpg" alt="M-R #1" />

						<img class="clickable-block" src="/images/Caughlan/Mayer&Rupp_60857_34.jpg" alt="M-R #2" />
					</a>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<p>
				<i>
					Although the style of the bell is totally different from any of those used by David Caughlan, the
					iron yoke from which the bell is suspended is identical in style to those on many Caughlan bells,
					right down to the bolt-in gudgeon pins.&nbsp; This tends to lend credence to the idea that
					bellfounders purchased cast iron fittings for their bells from iron foundries, rather than making
					them.&nbsp; The principal reason for this would be that the casting processes for the two metals are
					so dissimilar that it would not be profitable for most firms to try to do both kinds of work.
