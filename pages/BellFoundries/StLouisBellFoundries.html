			<h1>Bell Foundries in Saint Louis, Missouri, USA</h1>
			<p>
				At least 37 different business enterprises are known to have made, sold or advertised bells in the city of St.Louis at 
				various times during the last two-thirds of the 19th century, with a few of them lasting into the first half of the 20th 
				century.&nbsp; One of them was large enough to compete with the major bellfoundries to the east, and was among the four 
				minor American makers of chimes.
			</p>
			<p>
				These businesses are listed below in four groups.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<LI>
					"Known bellfoundries" are those for which positive evidence of bell foundry work exists, either as actual bells or as 
					identification or advertisement of themselves as bell (and brass) foundries.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					"Private label resellers" are those firms which sold under their own names bells that presumably had been made for them 
					by some other firm.&nbsp; The evidence for this is twofold: the resellers never advertised themselves as a bell or brass 
					foundry, and the style of their bells is identical to that of a known bellfoundry.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					"Known resellers" are those firms which are known to have sold bells made by others, either at retail or second-hand.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					"Possible bellfoundries or resellers of bells" are those firms which advertised bells but did not identify themselves as 
					foundries, and no bells bearing their name are (yet) known to exist.
				</LI>
			</ul>
			<p>
				In each group, the businesses are listed in order of first appearance.&nbsp; When a firm had different names at different 
				times, those specific names are listed in order of use under the name of a principal proprietor or a generic name.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				If you know of a bell which carries any of the names listed below, or a bell marked "St.Louis" with a name that is not
				listed below, please <A HREF="mailto:csz_stl@swbell.net?subject=A%20St.Louis-related%20bell">send me a message about it</A>.&nbsp;
				If possible, include photographs (the more detailed, the better); tell me the diameter of the bell (in inches, measured 
				across the mouth) and whatever is known of its history.&nbsp; In return, I can tell you something of the foundry's history
				and how your bell compares with others from the same source.&nbsp; On request, I can also provide free advice regarding 
				maintenance, restoration, etc.

			<p>
				NOTE:&nbsp; It is true that we don't yet have direct evidence of any contractual relationships between these firms and the 
				foundries which we presume to have made the bells which they sold under their own names.&nbsp; And it is true that the C.S.
				Bell company complained in their catalogues that their products had been used as patterns by imitators.&nbsp; However, we 
				believe that the imitators produced the anonymous bells which we have seen in the C.S.Bell style, and that the companies 
				listed here were sufficiently reputable not to have resorted to the procurement of imitations.
