			<h1>Bell Foundries in Saint Louis, Missouri, USA</h1>
			<p>
				At least 37 different business enterprises are known to have made, sold or advertised bells in the city
				of St.Louis at various times during the last two-thirds of the 19th century, with a few of them lasting
				into the first half of the 20th century.&nbsp; One of them was large enough to compete with the major
				bellfoundries to the east, and was among the four minor American makers of chimes.
			</p>
			<p>
				These businesses are listed below in four groups.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<LI>
					"Known bellfoundries" are those for which positive evidence of bell foundry work exists, either as
					actual bells or as identification or advertisement of themselves as bell (and brass) foundries.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					"Private label resellers" are those firms which sold under their own names bells that presumably had
					been made for them by some other firm.&nbsp; The evidence for this is twofold: the resellers never
					advertised themselves as a bell or brass foundry, and the style of their bells is identical to that
					of a known bellfoundry.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					"Known resellers" are those firms which are known to have sold bells made by others, either at
					retail or second-hand.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					"Possible bellfoundries or resellers of bells" are those firms which advertised bells but did not
					identify themselves as foundries, and no bells bearing their name are (yet) known to exist.
				</LI>
			</ul>
			<p>
				In each group, the businesses are listed in order of first appearance.&nbsp; When a firm had different
				names at different times, those specific names are listed in order of use under the name of a principal
				proprietor or a generic name.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					If you know of a bell which carries any of the names listed below, or a bell marked "St.Louis" with
					a name that is not listed below, please
					<a href="mailto:csz_stl@swbell.net?subject=A%20St.Louis-related%20bell">
						send me a message about it
					</A>.&nbsp;
					If possible, include photographs (the more detailed, the better); tell me the diameter of the bell
					(in inches, measured across the mouth) and whatever is known of its history.&nbsp; In return, I can
					tell you something of the foundry's history and how your bell compares with others from the same
					source.&nbsp; On request, I can also provide free advice regarding maintenance, restoration, etc.
				</p>

				NOTE:&nbsp; It is true that we don't yet have direct evidence of any contractual relationships between
				these firms and the foundries which we presume to have made the bells which they sold under their own
				names.&nbsp; And it is true that the C.S. Bell company complained in their catalogues that their
				products had been used as patterns by imitators.&nbsp; However, we believe that the imitators produced
				the anonymous bells which we have seen in the C.S.Bell style, and that the companies listed here were
				sufficiently reputable not to have resorted to the procurement of imitations.
