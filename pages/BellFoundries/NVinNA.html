			<h1>Naylor Vickers in North America</h1>
			<p>
				The Sheffield, England, steel manufactory of Naylor, Vickers &amp; Co. (later Vickers Sons &amp; Co., but commonly 
				referred to as simply "Naylor Vickers"), has long been known for the cast steel bells which it produced in the mid to 
				late 19th century.&nbsp; <SMALL>(See the <A HREF="#HISTORY">History reference</A> below.)</SMALL>&nbsp; With the coming 
				of the Internet, gathering and sharing of information has accelerated, yielding the realization that many of the Naylor 
				Vickers bells are in North America.&nbsp; As of October 2015, the distribution of bells known to have been supplied by 
				Naylor Vickers, whether surviving or not, is approximately as follows:

				That 1/4 of their known production went to North America (and almost all of that to the USA) is rather surprising, 
				considering that this export began very soon after Naylor Vickers began producing such bells.&nbsp; Also surprising 
				is the fact that some of these bells which are located in New England are hung on fittings of the style that is 
				characteristic of the <A HREF="data/IXfoundryHooperBlake.html">Hooper/Blake bellfoundry</A> of Boston, Massachusetts.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the surprise disappears with the revelation that the company had already established a sales office in 
				<A HREF="#Boston">Boston</A> before they began casting bells, and maintained it for more than 35 years.&nbsp;
				There were also agents or offices in <A HREF="#NYC">New York City</A> and <A HREF="#Phila">Philadelphia</A>;
				together, these were at that time the three largest and most important cities in the country.

			<h2>Boston Office</h2>
			<p>
				Doing business as "Naylor &amp; Co.," this office was in operation by 1850, with its business described as simply 
				"steel".&nbsp; In the city directories of 1865 through 1875, the subject of their business was described as "iron, 
				steel, and bells."&nbsp; The term "bells" was dropped sometime between 1875 and 1885, possibly because the production 
				of bells by the parent company was declining.
			</p>

			<h3>Findings from City Directories</h3>
			<p>
				Because not all of the Boston city directories have been examined, it is not entirely certain where Naylor &amp; Co. was 
				located, or rather, when the office changed location.&nbsp; Certainly it was located at 89 Milk street in 1850 and at 80 
				State street from 1855 to 1865.&nbsp; By 1870, the office was at 6 Oliver street, and there was also a facility on
				Constitution wharf.&nbsp; Those addresses were maintained through 1875 at least.&nbsp; However, by 1885 (when "bells" had 
				been dropped from the business description), the office was in room 23 of what was probably a general office building at
				70 Kilby street, and by 1905 the company was gone.
			</p>
			<p>
				For the same reason, it is not entirely certain how the principals of Naylor &amp; Co. changed throughout the years.&nbsp;
				The only one reported in 1850 was E. L. Benzon.&nbsp; In 1855, they were Edmund L. S. Benzon, Edward B. Huntington, Wm. L. 
				King, B. Schlesinger, and Geo. N. Vickers.&nbsp; The last-named was George Naylor Vickers, eldest son of one of the parent 
				firm's founders, and already a partner in that firm.&nbsp; He had come to the USA in 1848, and appears in the 1850 directory 
				in the hardware business.
			</p>
			<p>
				By 1865, Edmund Benzon and George Vickers had disappeared, and "B." Schlesinger was revealed as Barthold Schlesinger; the 
				latter remained a principal of the company throughout the rest of its existence, and was still living in Boston in 1905 
				(apparently retired).&nbsp; Also, William L. King had been replaced by George P. King; probably they were related, because 
				both had residences in the town of Roxbury.&nbsp; George King remained a principal through 1875, but by 1885 he was president 
				of the Norway Steel and Iron Co., which shared the office of Naylor &amp; Co. at 70 Kilby.
			</p>
			<p>
				Added to the principals in 1865 was Sebastian B. Schlesinger, who remained in that position through 1885, though by 1875 he 
				had taken on the additional duty of consul for Germany and by 1885 his residence was in New York (City).&nbsp; It seems 
				reasonable to assume that the two Schlesingers were related.&nbsp; Certainly their nationality might be taken as a reflection 
				of the German connection which was so important to Naylor Vickers' manufacture of cast steel bells.
			</p>
			<p>
				Edward B. Huntington remained a principal through 1870, but was gone by 1872.
			</p>
			<p>
				Curiously, even though the firm's name was obviously derived from Naylor of Naylor, Vickers &amp; Co., there does not seem to 
				have been a resident Naylor associated with it at any time - only a Vickers for the first few years.
			</p>

			<h3>Findings From Other Sources: </h3>
			<p>
				Searching the World Wide Web for additional information on the various principals of Naylor &amp; Co. (as well as the company 
				name), one finds a number of other interesting details about them.&nbsp; They are listed here in approximately chronological 
				order:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<LI>
					On Oct.28, 1848, George Naylor Vickers, age 18, arrived in New York City on the ship Sarah Sands, inbound from Liverpool.&nbsp;
					His occupation was listed as "Gent." (i.e., gentleman).
				</LI>
				<LI>
					On July 4, 1857, the barque Minona arrived in Boston harbor carrying 210 tons of iron consigned to Messrs. Naylor &amp; Co.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Sebastian Benson Schlesinger (1837-1917) was a German composer who studied music in Boston, wrote numerous songs, and served for 
					17 years as the German consul in Boston.&nbsp; On July 29, 1861, he enlisted in the Forty-fifth Regiment of the Massachusetts
					Volunteer Militia, presumably for service in the Civil War.&nbsp; The history of that regiment has not been investigated, but 
					obviously he survived his period of military duty.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Naylor &amp; Co. were subscribers in support of the North Polar Expedition by the schooner "United States" in 1866.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					In <U>The Nation</U> magazine for 01/25/1872, there is reported a speech given in Boston in which Naylor &amp; Co. were referenced 
					as "the great iron firm of this city".
				</LI>
				<LI>
					The properties at 6 Oliver Street and Constitution wharf appear to have been unaffected by the Great Fire of 1872, which destroyed 
					a large part of downtown Boston.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Barthold Schlesinger was married; in 1882, he and his wife began hosting at their Brookline residence a school which had previously 
					been located in Boston.&nbsp; In 1873, his portrait was painted by William Morris Hunt; it is now in the collection of the Museum 
					of Fine Arts in Boston.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					By the 1880s, the two Schlesingers may well have been the only active principals in the firm, because they are listed as the 
					plaintiffs in an 1881 lawsuit which attempted to recover damages from an 1880 breach of contract by a railroad construction firm 
					in Kansas.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					In 1881, Naylor &amp; Co. owned two iron smelters in Rutland County, Vermont.&nbsp; One was called the Titan Furnace, located on 
					road 15; it employed 21 men in the manufacture of pig-iron, consuming 1200 bushels of coal per day to produce ten tons of iron.&nbsp;
					Within the town of Pittsford was another furnace, capacity not reported.&nbsp; Clearly, Naylor & Co. were not simply importers of 
					English products.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					In 1887, the Schlesingers were involved in a lawsuit and counter-suit with the collector of customs in Boston, regarding the amount 
					of import duties on two shipments of wrought scrap iron from England.&nbsp; A shipment in Oct.1879 contained 170 tons, and a shipment 
					in Nov.1879 contained 200 tons; this may be indicative of the magnitude of the firm's operations.
				</LI>
			</ul>

			<h3>Conclusions:</h3>
			<p>
				Naylor Vickers, having an established office in Boston when their making of bells began, were well placed to begin exporting 
				their bells to North America as a sideline to their main business of iron and steel.&nbsp; The only bellfoundry known to have 
				been operating in or near Boston in the mid-19th c., that of Henry N. Hooper, described itself in the business directories as 
				primarily "copper dealers", though sometimes it was also classifed under Bells.&nbsp; Since New England was by this time a 
				well-settled region compared to the expanding western frontier, the market for traditional bronze bells may have been relatively
				small - as much in replacements for cracked bells as for new ones.&nbsp; So Hooper might not have been averse to cooperating 
				with Naylor &amp; Co. in the hanging of imported bells.&nbsp; In fact, Naylor & Co. might even have cooperated in the production 
				of the necessary cast iron fittings locally to avoid the necessity of importing finished goods with the associated high tariffs.&nbsp;
				It might even be that this situation prompted Hooper &amp; Co. to take a fresh look at their own bell business, resulting in the 
				production of four large chimes in the 1860s.

				Rev. David L. Cawley, bell historian, has written a long 
				<A HREF="http://www.georgedawson.homestead.com/files/Naylor_Vickers_DLC.doc">article</A> (Microsoft Word document, 56KB 
				download) about the steel bells produced by Naylor Vickers.&nbsp; It touches briefly on the history of Naylor, Vickers & 
				Co. and some of its principals in relation to their production of steel bells.&nbsp; Titled "Colonel Tom and his Cast Steel 
				Bells," this article was originally written to be a chapter in George Dawson's book, "Church Bells of Nottinghamshire."&nbsp;
				In 2004, it was expanded to its present size and was published in <U>The Ringing World</U>, pp.709-11 of that year's volume.

				Most of the supporting evidence for the narrative above comes from a series of entries in various Boston city directories.&nbsp;
				Those entries are reproduced in exact detail on the accompanying page of <A HREF="../Introduction/BostonData.html">Boston 
				city directory data</A>.&nbsp; When directories for the intervening years can be examined, they will undoubtedly lead to

				There exists a Deed of Partnership for Naylor, Vickers &amp; Co., dated 28 January 1853 and signed in London, Boston and New 
				York.&nbsp; The partners were G.P. Naylor and Edward Vickers of Sheffield, England; W.L. King, H.B. Butenschon, and M.J. 
				O'Connor of New York; and E.L. Benzon and G.N. Vickers of Boston.&nbsp; A second agreement was recorded the same year on 1 
				November, adding Frederick Lehmann of Scotland.
			</p>
			<p>
				Genealogical research shows that among these various principals, George Portus Naylor and Edward Vickers were brothers-in-law,
				Edward having married George's sister Ann (or Anne).&nbsp; George Naylor Vickers was Edward's eldest son, and his two younger 
				brothers (Thomas and Albert) would follow him into partnership in the family business in Sheffield the following year.
