						A vitally important aspect of the study of tower bells is the matter of how they are made.&nbsp;
						It isn't sufficient to say simply that they are cast from bronze (or occasionally other materials) 
						in a conventional shape.&nbsp; Present-day methods, makers and styles are inextricably connected 
						to the history of the development of the art and science of bellfounding, to the people who 
						contributed to each step in that development, and to the places and times in which each of them 
						worked.

					<p>
						More than 300 different bellfounders are known to have worked in the United States of America during the past three 
						centuries.&nbsp; Almost 200 of them produced traditional cast bronze bells, while others produced cast iron, cast 
						steel or "amalgam" bells.&nbsp; All of those which have been reported are listed and briefly described in
						<A HREF="../BellBooks/GoeppingerBook.html">Neil Goeppinger's authoritative book</A> or its 
						<A HREF="../BellBooks/GoeppingerBook2.html">supplement here</A>, even if their existence has not been confirmed.&nbsp;
						(Some listed firms may actually have been distributors of bells from other manufacturers, and some names may have 
						been mis-reported.)

					<p>
						Some of the major centers of this industry, now almost vanished, are identified below, in order by state.

						<p>
							If you have a question about any bellfoundry (whether mentioned in these pages or not), or if you have an 
							unidentified tower or farm bell and want assistance in discovering who made it, please 
							<A HREF="mailto:csz_stl@swbell.net?subject=TowerBells%20BellFoundries%20inquiry">send an inquiry</A>.&nbsp;
							Include photographs if possible, preferably large and sharp, because it is often possible to identify the maker 
							of a bell by its style, even when there is no inscription on it, or when a maker's inscription is partially 
							damaged or obscured.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you have an inquiry about a smaller bell, especially one of collectible size, you should instead post it to 
							the Forum of the <A HREF="http://www.americanbell.org/">American Bell Association International, Inc.</A>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Including one or more photographs with such an inquiry is highly recommended.

					<h2 id="baltimore">Baltimore, Maryland</h2>
					<p>
						This city housed several significant regional bellfoundries, and a suburb was for many years home to the only 
						historic American bellfoundry to have survived past the middle of the 20th century.&nbsp; Though in its later 
						years it no longer actually made bells, the McShane Bell Foundry was one of the three major American makers of 
						chimes, besides producing thousands of single bells and peals of 2 to 4 bells.&nbsp; The data side of this Website 
						has an <A HREF="data/IXfoundryMcShane.html">index of McShane chimes</A>, which includes an outline of the history 
						of the foundry and the recent relocation of the corporate name.
					</p>
		
					<h2 id="boston">Boston & Vicinity, Massachusetts</h2>
					<p>
						Although there were small-scale bellfounders working in America at least as early as 1717, the first significant 
						bellfoundry was that of Col.Aaron Hobart, which operated in Abingdon for thirty years beginning in 1861.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first major post-Revolutionary bellfoundry was established in 1792 in Boston by the famous patriot Paul Revere.&nbsp;
						For further information about it, see the <A HREF="RevereFoundry.html">Revere foundry</A> page here.
					</p>
					<p>
						Various apprentices of Paul Revere were later involved in the establishment of at least two regionally important bell 
						foundries.&nbsp; One was set up by George Holbrook in the nearby town of Medway; for further information, see the 
						<A HREF="HolbrookFoundry.html">Holbrook foundry page</A> here.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another, begun by Henry Hooper, was one of the four minor American makers of chimes.&nbsp; The data side of this Website 
						has an <A HREF="data/IXfoundryHooperBlake.html">index of Hooper/Blake chimes</A>, with an outline of the history of that 
						foundry.
					</p>
		
					<h2 id="saint-louis">Saint Louis, Missouri</h2>
					<p>
						At least 37 different business enterprises are known to have made, sold or advertised bells in the city of St.Louis at 
						various times during the last two-thirds of the 19th century, with a few of them lasting into the first half of the 20th 
						century.&nbsp; One of them was large enough to compete successfully with the major bellfoundries to the east, and was 
						among the four minor American makers of chimes.&nbsp; The data side of this Website has an 
						<A HREF="data/IXfoundryStuckstede.html">index of Stuckstede chimes</A>, with an outline of the history of the two Stuckstede 
						foundries.
					</p>
					<p>
						For further information, see the <A HREF="StLouisBellFoundries.html">Saint Louis Bell Foundries</A> page here.
					</p>
		
					<h2 id="new-york">New York, New York</h2>
					<p>
						As the largest metropolitan area in the country, and one of the oldest, this was the home of a large number of different 
						bellfoundries in the 18th and 19th centuries, though none of them lasted very long nor produced many bells.
					</p>
		
					<h2 id="troy-new-york">Troy and West Troy (Watervliet), New York</h2>
					<p>
						These towns were the homes of two of the largest bellfoundries in America, operated by competing branches of the Meneely 
						family.&nbsp; Both of those foundries were among the three major American makers of chimes.&nbsp; Another bellfoundry in 
						Troy was among the four minor American makers of chimes.&nbsp; A few other bellfoundries were also located here from time 
						to time.&nbsp; West Troy, originally named Gibbonsville, later was renamed Watervliet.&nbsp; The data side of this Website 
						has indexes of <A HREF="data/IXfoundryJones.html">chimes by Jones</A> (Troy),
						<A HREF="data/IXfoundryMeneelyWvlt.html">carillons and chimes by Meneely (Watervliet)</A> 
						and <A HREF="data/IXfoundryMeneelyTroy.html">chimes by Meneely (Troy)</A>; each of those three pages includes a sketch of 
						that foundry's history plus links to further information.
					</p>
		
					<h2 id="southwestern-ohio">Southwestern Ohio</h2>
					<p>
						Several bellfoundries in Cincinnati, including two of the largest and longest-lived in the USA, made either bronze or iron 
						bells.&nbsp; One of those, the Buckeye Bell Foundry (operated by Vanduzen), was among the four minor American makers of chimes;
						the data side of this Website has an <A HREF="data/IXfoundryVanduzen.html">index of Vanduzen chimes</A>, including a brief 
						sketch of the history of this foundry.
					</p>
					<p>
						The largest of many American producers of iron or steel bells was probably the 
						<A HREF="HillsboroFoundry.html">C.S.Bell Company</A>, located in the town of Hillsboro, east of Cincinnati.&nbsp; Using a 
						special cast steel alloy called "crystal metal," this firm produced bells of all sizes from 12" diameter postmount farm or 
						dinner bells to 48" diameter church bells.&nbsp; These bells, unlike those made of bronze, do not carry any inscription 
						(except for a size number on the top).&nbsp; Instead, the identification of the maker is found on the yoke from which the 
						bell hangs.
					</p>
					<p>Two of the three modern bellfoundries in the USA are located in this area:</p>
					<ul>
						<LI>
							<A HREF="http://www.mwbells.com/">Meeks, Watson &amp; Company</A> is located in Georgetown, southeast of Cincinnati.&nbsp;
							The data side of this Website has an index of this foundry's <A HREF="data/IXfoundryMeeksWatson.html">carillons and chimes</A>;
							that includes contact information as well as a history of the company.
						</LI>
						<LI>
							<A HREF="http://www.verdin.com/">The Verdin Company</A> of Cincinnati, for nearly a century a major producer of tower 
							clocks (and still the foremost such company in the USA) has a mobile foundry capable of casting single bells weighing 
							up to 1000 pounds.&nbsp; Constructed to carry out a contract for casting a bell in each of the 88 counties of Ohio,
							during that state's year-long bicentennial celebration, this unique equipment is still available for use, though you 
							won't find mention of that on the company's extensive Website.&nbsp; But you can find bits of information about it 
							scattered throughout Verdin's <A HREF="http://www.verdin.com/bicentennial_news.html">compilation of Bicentennial news 
							articles</A>.&nbsp; It should be noted that although members of the Verdin family have been involved in the manufacture 
							of tower clocks (formerly known as town clocks) for seven generations, the Verdin Company as it exists today dates from 
							the formation of the I.T.Verdin Machine Company in 1927/8.&nbsp;
					</ul>
		
					<h2 id="virginia">Virginia</h2>
					<p>
						Although it was never a a major center of bellfounding, this state is now home to the third and newest modern bellfoundry 
						in the USA, that of <A HREF="http://www.sunderlinfoundry.com/">B.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Sunderlin</A>.&nbsp; The data side of this 
						Website has an index of this foundry's work on <A HREF="data/IXfoundrySunderlin.html">carillons and chimes</A>.

					<h1 id="bellfounders-elsewhere">Bellfounders Elsewhere</h1>
					<p>
						Little is known of the foundries that made bells in Mexico, Central and South America, or the Orient, though it is clear 
						that some bells were cast in these places as well as being exported to them from Europe.&nbsp; Although a few of them 
						cast great bells, and thus are mentioned in foundry indexes, none of them are known to have made bells for carillons or 
						chimes.
