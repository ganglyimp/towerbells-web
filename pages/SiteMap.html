		Elsewhere on the World Wide Web (colloquially called the Web), a page like this would be 
		called a "site map."&nbsp; Here it's called a "Website map" because we use the word "site" 
		to mean the location of a tower bell instrument of some kind.&nbsp; That is most commonly 
		seen in the term "site data page", which is a page (on this Website) that gives a fairly 
		extensive description of one particular tower bell instrument.
	</p>

	<h2>Website Map for TowerBells.org</h2>

		This map covers only the topmost part of this Website, which is only a small portion of the 
		total.&nbsp; For the contents of the rest, see the Data Top page referenced in this map.&nbsp;

			<br/>= Introduction to, and Contents of, site data pages about carillons, chimes, rings, etc., 
			together with index pages and regional locator maps to find them.&nbsp; Both conventional bells and

				<LI>
					Each index list linked from the Data Top page lists a group of index pages for a specific 
					geographic area of the world or for a specific subject (such as bellfoundries).
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Each index page under any index list points into a set of site data pages, each describing one 
					of the tower bell instruments which are known or presumed to be extant within the scope of that 
					index.&nbsp; Under any particular index list, each of the index pages lists that set of site data 
					pages in a different sequence, depending on the nature of the index.

	<h2 id="NavTips">Tips on navigating this Website</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Every page outside the Data section has a navigation bar at the top (as this one does), 
			showing one possible hierarchical path between the home page and the current page.&nbsp;
			That bar has links back to the preceding pages on that path.&nbsp; (Obviously the home page 
			has no need of such a navigation bar.)
		</li>
		<li>
			Every page except the home page has a 4-item menu bar near the bottom of the page (as this 
			one does), presenting links to a few useful pages that are not hierarchically connected.&nbsp;
			The selection of items presented on such menu bars in the Data section of this Website is different 
			from the selection presented elsewhere.
		</li>
		<li>
			This Website Map page, together with the Contents portion of the Data Top page, shows all major 
			topic (i.e., non-data) pages in a hierarchical layout.
		</li>
		<li>
			Every site data page can be reached from several different index pages as well as from a regional 
			locator map.&nbsp; The Links section of each site data page contains several back-links to the 
			referencing lines of various such index pages (though not all).&nbsp; This enables finding any site 
			based on a variety of criteria, as well as exploring the relationships between any site and others 
			that are similar to it.
		</li>
		<li>
			Index pages and other list pages within the Data section have a link near the bottom which goes back 
			to the "index list" page for that particular set of related indexes.
		</li>
		<li>
			There are numerous cross-links between pages, as well as jump links within pages.&nbsp;
			Use the status bar of your Web browser to foresee where a link will take you.
