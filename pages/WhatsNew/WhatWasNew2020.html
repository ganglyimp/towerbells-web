				Added two new features to the regional locator map systems:&nbsp; (1) When an instrument contains a great bell 
				cast by a different maker than the majority of the instrument, the text in the info window for that site may 
				offer the choice of opening the site data page for the instrument or going to the descriptive paragraph in the 
				list of great bells for that region.&nbsp; (2) When the location of an instrument is uncertain, the info window 
				for that site will report that "zoom is limited," meaning that the associated maptack will disappear when the 
				map is zoomed in too closely. <br/>
				These features are now described in the Help window for regional locator maps.
			</p>
			<p>
				Updated the locator map links in four lists of great bells; resolved several inconsistencies in indexing of 
				great bells and site data pages; mapped several listed great bells (not itemized).
