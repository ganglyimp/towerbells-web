			<h1>What's New in These Pages?</h1>
			<p>
				This page reports on the evolution of this Website as it occurs, both for the sake of those who like to 
				follow such things and to help the Webmaster remember what was done and when.&nbsp; The changes are 
				reported in reverse order, with the latest at the top.&nbsp; Dates show when groups of pages were installed 
				on the Web server, which is not always the same as the internal dates of revision of individual pages.
			</p>
			<p>
				This report covers not only the root directory but all subdirectories.
			</p>
			<p>
				<small>
					<b>NOTE:</b>&nbsp; If you have a tool or method for monitoring changed Webpages, this is the only page 
					that you need to monitor on this Website, because it will always point to all other recently changed 
					pages where the cause of the change was something other than correction of a typographic error or 
					addition of an external Weblink.
				</small>
			</p>

		<section>
			<h2>2023/05/30</h2>
			<p>
				Revised 21 site data pages and added 1<!-- total 22 -->
				(see <A HREF="data/IX230324.HTM">list</A> or <A HREF="data/atlas/GRegionalMap.html?XM230324">map</A>);
				revised affected indexes and regional maps accordingly.
				<!-- Revised Sunderlin foundry indexing, assigning code letter "s" -->
				<!-- changed inscription spacing in WanamakerBells -->
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>2023/05/16</h2>
			<p>
				Fixed several broken links, and improved a few locator maps for great bells not in carillons.
			</p>
			<p>
				Removed to archive all update lists for 2010.
				<!-- IX10nnnn.HTM, linked in NewsHistory10,11(GCNA),TB -->
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>2023/05/11-13</h2>
			<p>
				Changed to UTF-8 the page encoding of all root pages and essays, 
				as well as some text pages in the data section, to make it easier to verify that
				the public Website matches private mirrors (which are on Macintosh machines).
			</p>
			<p>
				Fixed several broken links.
			</p>
			<p>
				Revised the "Direction" note block which follows (and floats in this page):
				<blockquote>
					<h3 style="text-align: center">"To travel far, you must choose a direction"</h3>
					<p style="text-align: center">
						William F. Woo, "<I>Letters from the Editor</I>" (chapter title)
					</p>

					<p>
						The direction in which the TowerBells Website is traveling can be seen in the worklist which is set 
						out below.&nbsp; In roughly prioritized order, this shows the major tasks which the author has set 
						himself, and which are intended to result in future news items on this page.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Solve the problem of why Map Service Select does not always pass through a map request when it 
							should automatically do so.
							<!--put /images/ stuff into proper sub-folders. -->
						</li>
						<li>
							Post to the site data pages all additions and changes reported by correspondents, found in 
							publications, or discovered from Google Alert messages, revising indexes, locator map links and 
							regional locator maps as needed.
						</li>
						<li>
							Improve the new Error 404 handler to redirect requests for deleted site data pages automatically.&nbsp;
							(It already tells human visitors why they are no longer present.)
						</li>
						<li>
							Construct a page that describes and illustrates the various types of keyboards, chimestands and 
							chiming racks that are in use in various parts of the world.
						</li>
						<li>
							Finish mapping independent great bells already listed in Europe, Russia and Asia-Pacific (Oriental 
							profile).
						</li>
						<li>
							Enhance page-generator code to display full technical information for prior phases of an instrument; 
							then regenerate site data pages for all multi-phase instruments.
						</li>
						<li>
							Investigate anomalies in various summaries, as well as discrepancies between instrument counts in 
							summaries and the corresponding indexes.
						</li>
						<li>
							Enhance the statistics and/or filter panes on regional maps with respect to type of instrument, 
							type of institution, denomination.
						</li>
						<li>
							Extend the Google site locator map functions to show (additional) nearby sites at the user's 
							request.<!-- using new Rgn.xml file -->
						</li>
						<li>
							Move existing photos in site data pages from Links block to Photos block.
							<!-- 
								See "graphics/site-specific" and "images" in "latest/data/revisions not expected/";
								also photos without thumbnails in /xx/ subdirs 
							-->
						</li>
						<li>
							Search my photo archives for relevant material which can be posted to site data pages, including 
							photos contributed from others which should have been posted already.
						</li>
						<li>
							Regenerate all site data pages older than July 2012 for which information exists 
							<!-- CAN'T DO UNTIL DE/IT CHIMES ARE DONE!!! -->
							about auxiliary mechanisms and/or tower details.
						</li>
						<li>
							Add numerous entries to the lists of great bells for continental European countries.
						</li>
						<li>
							Write an essay on HTML maintainability, for the guidance of those who don't appreciate the 
							necessity of it and the subtleties involved.
						</li>
						<li>
							Find and fix obsolete links to the Global Gazetteer.
						</li>
						<li>
							Supply all of the "planned" items listed on the <a href="data/Data_Top.html">Data_Top</a> page.
							<!-- and elsewhere -->
						</li>
						<li>
							Review the index to the work of miscellaneous bellfoundries to determine whether additional 
							bellfoundry-specific indexes should be constructed.
							<!-- AFTER THE LAST UPDATE OF A YEAR IS FILED, add a new set of file counts to Website History -->
						</li>
						<li>
							Regenerate all Summaries that are more than a year old.
							<!-- In mid-2023: Split 2022 news into a separate history file. -->
						</li>
						<li>
							Actively hunt for information to resolve various "unknown" details (foundry, year, weight, number, 
							keyboard ranges, etc.), including location and status of Deagan tower chimes that are not yet 
							mapped.
							<!-- Bourdon weights & chromatics codes will affect grid summaries -->
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The words "roughly prioritized" indicate that work on many of these tasks may be going on 
						simultaneously, so that particular sub-tasks may be completed in a different sequence.&nbsp;
						There will also be changes from time to time that have no apparent connection to any of these major 
						tasks.&nbsp; Furthermore, there will be no explicit description of revisions to this task list, nor 
						any record of prior revisions to it, though it will usually move up on this page whenever such a 
						revision occurs.

				<b>NOTE:</b> Prior to 2022, the common convention for recording telephone numbers in the USA was to use the 
				format "(nnn)nnn-nnnn", indicating that the first three digits (the so-called "area code") were not used when 
				calling from a wired telephone within the geographical area of that code.&nbsp; In early 2022, a nationwide 
				change made use of the area code mandatory in all circumstances.&nbsp; Therefore, in subsequent updates to 
				this Website, all telephone and fax numbers in the USA will be reformatted as "nnn-nnn-nnnn".&nbsp; (However, 
				updates will not be done solely for reformatting purposes.)

				Revised the <a href="data/IX-BellfoundriesAdvice.html">Bellfoundries advice</a> page to explain why and how
