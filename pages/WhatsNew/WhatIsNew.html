						This page reports on the evolution of this Website as it occurs, both for the sake of those who like to 
						follow such things and to help the Webmaster remember what was done and when.&nbsp; The changes are 
						reported in reverse order, with the latest at the top.&nbsp; Dates show when groups of pages were installed 
						on the Web server, which is not always the same as the internal dates of revision of individual pages.
					</p>
					<p>
						This report covers not only the root directory but all subdirectories.
					</p>
					<p>
						<small>
							<b>NOTE:</b>&nbsp; If you have a tool or method for monitoring changed Webpages, this is the only page 
							that you need to monitor on this Website, because it will always point to all other recently changed 
							pages where the cause of the change was something other than correction of a typographic error or 
							addition of an external Weblink.

	<!--SITE DIRECTION BLOCK-->
	<template id="siteDirection">
		<blockquote>
			<h3 style="text-align: center">"To travel far, you must choose a direction"</h3>
			<p style="text-align: center">
				William F. Woo, "<I>Letters from the Editor</I>" (chapter title)
			</p>
			<p>
				The direction in which the TowerBells Website is traveling can be seen in the worklist which is set 
				out below.&nbsp; In roughly prioritized order, this shows the major tasks which the author has
				set himself, and which are intended to result in future news items on this page.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<LI>
					Solve the problem of why WordPerfect does not preserve the width of spaces in fixed-pitch fonts; this is 
					preventing the production of correctly-formatted PDFs from the database that underlies this Website.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Identify (and if possible correct) all entries where an instrument has an Extended phase but not a Foundation 
					phase. 
				</LI>
				<!-- Make sure all instruments containing Great bells have appropriate standard
					 links; ditto for keyboard ranges on all grand carillons. -->
				<LI>
					Solve the problem of why Map Service Select does not always pass through a map request when it should 
					automatically do so based on previous settings.
				</LI>
				<!-- put /images/ stuff into proper sub-folders. -->
				<LI>
					Post to the site data pages all additions and changes reported by correspondents, found in publications, or 
					discovered from Google Alert messages, revising indexes, locator map links and regional locator maps as needed.
				</LI>
				<!-- find and re-verify all W3C validations -->
				<LI>
					Improve the new Error 404 handler to redirect requests for deleted site data pages automatically.&nbsp; (It already 
					tells human visitors why they are no longer present.)
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Construct a page that describes and illustrates the various types of keyboards, chimestands and chiming racks 
					that are in use in various parts of the world.
				</LI>
				<!-- Check Tufts Digital Library for 1860 Boston directory + other missing years -->
				<LI>
					Finish mapping independent great bells already listed in Europe, Russia and Asia-Pacific (Oriental profile).
				</LI>
				<!-- Modify regional map system to enable "zoom and exclude", so that a zoom 
					 from a cluster marker shows ONLY what was "under" that marker, and not 
					 anything from adjacent areas, by making use of <cin> tags. -->
				<LI>
					Investigate anomalies in various summaries, as well as discrepancies between instrument counts in summaries and 
					the corresponding indexes.
				</LI>
				<!-- finish KeneyClockTower.html -->
				<LI>
					Enhance the statistics and/or filter panes on regional maps with respect to type of instrument, type of institution, 
					denomination.
				</LI>
				<!-- Modify the RegionalMap program so that cluster pins and country pins
					 with z=0 do not zoom anywhere, but act as place-holders. -->
				<LI>
					Extend the Google site locator map functions to show (additional) nearby sites at the user's request.
					<!-- using new Rgn.xml file -->
				</LI>
				<!-- Add information on ethics and professional conduct. -->
				<LI>
					Move existing photos in site data pages from Links block to Photos block.
					<!-- See "graphics/site-specific" and "images" in "latest/data/revisions not expected/";
						 also photos without thumbnails in /xx/ subdirs -->
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Search my photo archives for relevant material which can be posted to site data pages, including photos 
					contributed from others which should have been posted already.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Regenerate all site data pages older than July 2012 for single-phase sites for which information exists 
					<!-- CAN'T DO UNTIL DE/IT CHIMES ARE DONE!!! -->
					about auxiliary mechanisms and/or tower details.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Add numerous entries to the lists of great bells for continental European countries.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Write an essay on HTML maintainability, for the guidance of those who don't appreciate the necessity of it 
					and the subtleties involved.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Find and fix obsolete links to the Global Gazetteer.
				</LI>
				<LI>
					Supply all of the "planned" items listed on the <a href="/data/Data_Top.html">Data_Top</a> page. 
					<!-- and elsewhere -->
				</LI>
				<!-- Update all hardcopy files that are more than a year old.
					 REQUIRES solving WordPerfect spacing problem -->
				<LI>
					Review the index to the work of miscellaneous bellfoundries to determine whether additional bellfoundry-specific 
					indexes should be constructed.
				</LI>
				<!-- AFTER THE LAST UPDATE OF A YEAR IS FILED, add a new set of file counts to Website History -->
				<LI>
					Regenerate all Summaries that are more than a year old.
				</LI>
				<!-- In mid-2024: Split 2023 news into a separate history file. -->
				<LI>
					Actively hunt for information to resolve various "unknown" details (foundry, year, weight, number, keyboard ranges, etc.),
					including location and status of Deagan tower chimes that are not yet mapped.
				</LI>
				<!-- Bourdon weights & chromatics codes will affect grid summaries -->
			</ul>

			<p>
				The words "roughly prioritized" indicate that work on many of these tasks may be going on simultaneously, 
				so that particular sub-tasks may be completed in a different sequence.&nbsp; There will also be changes 
				from time to time that have no apparent connection to any of these major tasks.&nbsp; Furthermore, there 
				will be no explicit description of revisions to this task list, nor any record of prior revisions to it,
				though it will usually move up on this page whenever such a revision occurs.
