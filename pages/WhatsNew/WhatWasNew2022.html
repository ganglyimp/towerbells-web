						This page reports on the evolution of this Website during the year 2022.&nbsp; This helps to keep the 
						<A HREF="WhatIsNew.html">"What's New"</A> page to a manageable size.&nbsp; The changes are reported in 
						reverse order, with the latest at the top.&nbsp; Dates show when groups of pages were installed on the Web 
						server, which is not always the same as the internal dates of revision of individual pages.
					</p>
				</section>

						photographs of significant buildings; but left our Emporis Hints page intact to show what has been lost.&nbsp;

						to the underlying database, there is neither list nor map to reference these changed pages.

					</p>
					<p>
						<b>NOTE:</b> Prior to 2022, the common convention for recording telephone numbers in the USA was to use the 
						format "(nnn)nnn-nnnn", indicating that the first three digits (the so-called "area code") were not used when 
						calling from a wired telephone within the geographical area of that code.&nbsp; In early 2022, a nationwide 
						change made use of the area code mandatory in all circumstances.&nbsp; Therefore, in subsequent updates to 
						this Website, all telephone and fax numbers in the USA will be reformatted as "nnn-nnn-nnnn".&nbsp; (However, 
						updates will not be done solely for reformatting purposes.)

						including the addition of "practice console."

						Revised the report generator program so that site data pages produced in the future for traditional carillons 
						will clearly indicate that the practice console status is unknown when that is true. 
					</p>
