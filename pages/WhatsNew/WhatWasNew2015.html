		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>2015/05/23</h2>
			<p>
				Replaced both regional locator map systems (one for conventional bells and one for tubular bells) with a 
				consolidated system based on the current application program interface (API V.3) from Google Maps.&nbsp;
				<i>This is the last step in merging the original TowerBells.org Website with the data migrated from the 
				GCNA Website in April 2012.</i>&nbsp; Newly added functionality includes new markers (map-tack icons) showing 
				more types of instruments, as well as the ability to display multi-region maps of the visitor's choice.&nbsp;
				Revised the <A HREF="data/Data_Top.html">Data Top page</A> appropriately.&nbsp; Removed all locator maps for 
				prior update packages and their links in this page.
				<!-- conventional: IX131219, IX140305 IX140309 IX140515 XM140610 
					XM140805 IX140807 IX141022 XM150201 -->
				<!-- tubular: XM140102 XM140306 XM140826 XM141121 -->
			</p>
			<p>
				Revised the site locator map system to use the current application program interface from Google Maps.&nbsp;
				Also, the help and control panel at the right of the map has been improved, and scrolling of the map page is 
				much less likely to be needed.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>
				Revised some map help pages, since Google's current Maps API no longer provides a method for detecting whether 
				a visitor's Web browser is supported by Google Maps, as the previous Maps API did.
			</p>
			<p>
				Added a new page of <A HREF="data/GazetteerNotes.html">Notes on the Global Gazetteer</A>.
				<!-- fixed indexing of NLUTRTD1, from chime to peal -->
			</p>
			<p>
				Added a section of <A HREF="../Essays/UnrelatedEssays.html">essays on unrelated subjects</A>.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>2015/05/02</h2> <!-- no separate update package -->
			<p>Added Global Gazetteer links to 25 site data pages (not listed).</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>2015/04/29</h2> <!-- no separate update package -->
			<p>
				Revised 310 site data pages so that site data pages for tubular tower chimes will use the same locator map 
				routine that pages for other instruments do.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>2015/04/28</h2> <!-- no separate update package -->
			<p>Revised 2316 site data pages to change the location of the MapQuest link icon.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>2015/04/14</h2>
			<p>
				Revised the regional locator map system for instruments made of conventional bells to present a clearer 
				distinction between the maptack icons used for traditional versus non-traditional carillons.
				<!-- fixed combined /atlas entries for Hingham MA, Shreveport LA, Abilene & Dallas TX;
					Hobart, Melbourne & Perth AU; -->
				<!-- 2015/02/05 - add empty favicon.ico -->

			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>2015/02/05</h2>
			<p>
				Revised 31 site data pages (see <A HREF="data/IX150201.HTM">list</A>);
				<!-- or <A HREF="data/maps/GoogleRegionalMapTB.html?XM150201">map</A>), -->
				revised affected indexes and regional maps accordingly.&nbsp; All are for Deagan tubular tower chimes, and 
				most of the changes were prompted by email failures in the general announcement of the preceding update 
				package (below).
				<!-- removed "lists of links" plans from area pages -->
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>2015/01/30</h2> <!-- fix punctuation error in TubularBells -->
			<p>
				Revised 212 site data pages and added 2 (see <A HREF="data/IX141121.HTM">list</A>);
				<!-- or <A HREF="data/maps/GoogleRegionalMapTB.html?XM141121">map</A>), -->
				revised affected indexes and regional maps accordingly.&nbsp; All are for Deagan tubular tower chimes, and 
				most of the changes were prompted by information recently acquired from a Deagan book of installation records
				for the northeastern USA.&nbsp; Important information newly available includes not only location and major 
				equipment but also identification of the donor and the installer.&nbsp; Most of the revised pages have had 
				locator maps added if they did not already have them; the exceptions are systems that are warehoused awaiting 
				resale or reinstallation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Removed site data pages about former Deagan tubular tower chimes that were in the 
				<A HREF="data/TU_no_more.html#CLCM">Baptist Church of the Master</A>, Cleveland, OH;
				in <A HREF="data/TU_no_more.html#BTLR">Butler, PA</A>;
				in <A HREF="data/TU_no_more.html#CLRF">Clearfield, PA</A>;
				in <A HREF="data/TU_no_more.html#PHLK">B.P.O.E. Lodge #2</A>, Philadelphia, PA;

				in <A HREF="data/TU_no_more.html#RCLB">Rochester, NY</A>;
				and in <A HREF="data/TU_no_more.html#SYCB">Syracuse, NY</A>;
				replaced them with corresponding paragraphs (linked above) in the page of tubular chimes that are no more;
				added a paragraph about a newly-identified former Deagan tubular tower chime at 
				<A HREF="data/TU_no_more.html#NYSP">St.Peter's Lutheran Church</A>, New York, NY; deleted the site data page 
				for Park View Cemetery, Detroit, MI, upon discovering that it had been relocated to <A HREF="data/OHTOLECM.HTM">Toledo, OH</A>, 
				for which a site data page already existed; revised affected indexes and regional maps accordingly, along with 
				the <A HREF="../TubularBells/DeaganSites.html">Deagan sites list</A> and the 
				<A HREF="../TubularBells/DeaganSummary.html">Deagan summary table</A>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Repaired numerous broken internal links, fixed numerous minor syntax errors and corrected encodings of several 
				special characters (not itemized here), in the course of preparing to re-host this Website with a different company
				before the current hosting contract expires.&nbsp; The company used since early 2012 (GoDaddy.com) terminated its 
				Website statistics service in Nov.2013, and prohibits the use of third-party tools to identify broken external links,
				making it unsatisfactory for my purposes.
