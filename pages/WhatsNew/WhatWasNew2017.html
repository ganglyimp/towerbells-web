			<p>
				This page reports on the evolution of this Website during the year 2017.&nbsp; This helps to keep the 
				<A HREF="WhatIsNew.html">"What's New"</A> page to a manageable size.&nbsp; The changes are reported in 
				reverse order, with the latest at the top.&nbsp; Dates of entries show when pages were installed on the 
				Web server, which is not always the same as their internal dates of revision.
