			<h1>What was new in these pages?</h1>
			<p>
				This page reports on the evolution of this Website during the year 2019.&nbsp; This helps to keep the 
				<A HREF="WhatIsNew.html">"What's New"</A> page to a manageable size.&nbsp; The changes are reported in 
				reverse order, with the latest at the top.&nbsp; Dates show when groups of pages were installed on the 
				Web server, which is not always the same as the internal dates of revision of individual pages.  
			</p>
		</header>

		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>2019/12/19</h2>

			<h2>2019/12/17</h2>
			<p>
				Revised the document type and/or character set encoding of numerous indexes, summaries and miscellaneous pages
