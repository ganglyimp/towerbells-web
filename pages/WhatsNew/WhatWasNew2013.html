						This page reports on the evolution of this Website during the year 2013.&nbsp; This helps to keep the 
						<a href="/towerbells-web/pages/WhatsNew/WhatIsNew.html">"What's New"</a> page to a manageable size.&nbsp; The changes are 
						reported in reverse order, with the latest at the top.&nbsp; Dates of entries show when pages were 
						installed on the Web server, which is not always the same as their internal dates of revision.  
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1 id="2013-12-18">2013/12/18</h1>
					<p>
						Revised 21 site data pages and added 2 (see <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IX131205.HTM">list</a>); revised affected indexes 
						and regional maps accordingly.&nbsp; Note that one of the new pages is actually a replacement for a previously
						existing page, reflecting the relocation to Nashotah of the ring formerly intended for Pewakukee.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
						Replaced a site data page with a paragraph about the former Deagan tubular tower chime in the
						<a href="/towerbells-web/data/TU_no_more.html#VAGW">George Washington Masonic National Memorial</a>; revised affected indexes 
						and regional maps accordingly.
					</p>

					<p>
						Revised 48 site data pages and added 5 (see <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IX131001.HTM">list</a>); revised affected indexes 
						and regional maps accordingly.&nbsp; Note that one of the new pages is actually a replacement for a previously
						existing page, reflecting the relocation of the Mostyn House School carillon to Charterhouse School.&nbsp;
						29 new photos are included.
					</p>
					<p>
						<!-- minor tweaks to TU_no_more -->
						Replaced site data page for a Deagan tubular tower chime reported to have been in "Oklahome City Cemetery" 
						with a paragraph about the former chime in <a href="/towerbells-web/data/TU_no_more.html#OKOC">Memorial Park Cemetery</a>
						in the same city; revised affected indexes and regional maps accordingly.
					</p>
					<p>
						Added the bass bell of the Canberra carillon to the list of <a href="/towerbells-web/data/APGreatBellsW.html#AUCNBRNC1">great

					</p>
					<p>
						Revised the Deagan historical <a href="/towerbells-web/pages/TubularBells/DeaganSites.html">list</a> and

						over the past two years.
					</p>
					<p>
						Removed the 10-bell chime of Victoria, BC, from the list of sites that are no more, upon receiving information 
						as to the current whereabouts and future plans for these bells.&nbsp; A new site data page for it has been added

					<p>
						Revised 9 site data pages (see <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IX130822.HTM">list</a>); indexes and regional maps were not

						founder.
