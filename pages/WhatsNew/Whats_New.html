      <h1>What's new in these pages?</h1>
      <p>
        This page reports on the evolution of this collection of pages during the early part of the year 2012, and is the 
        last such report for the set of pages which were migrated here from the Data section of the GCNA Website on 1 April 
        2012.&nbsp; For subsequent news of the evolution of the merged Website, see the post-merger 
        <a href="/towerbells-web/pages/WhatsNew/WhatIsNew.html">What's New page</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page reports on the evolution of this collection of pages as it occurs, both for the sake of those who like to 
        follow such things and to help us remember what was done and when.&nbsp; The changes are reported in reverse order, 
        with the latest (the "news item") at the top.&nbsp; Dates of entries show when pages were installed on the Web server, 
        which is not always the same as their internal dates of revision.&nbsp; Revisions to the list of non-carillon things 
        will not be reported, nor will minor (cosmetic) editorial fixes (though the revision dates of such files will change).

    <section>
      <h2>2012/08/11</h2>
      <p>
        Split 2011 news into the separate history file referenced below, to save space here; also removed all update locator 
        maps for that year and their links.&nbsp; Removed pre-merger update locator maps for 2012, and removed their links 
        from this page.
        <!-- IX110114, IX101125, IX120317, IX120309, IX120218, IX120201, IX120120, IX111226 -->

      <h2>2012/03/23</h2>
      <p>
        Revised 24 site data pages and added 7 (see <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IX120317.HTM">list</a>);

        revised affected indexes and regional locator maps accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Revised the <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IXfoundryVanbergen.html">Vanbergen foundry index</a> to show the origin of instruments -

      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>2012/03/17</h2>
      <p>
        Revised numerous foundry index pages to use the Vanbergen name consistently.&nbsp; (it had been "van Bergen" in some 
        cases).&nbsp;<!-- corrected fdy indexing of MTMISSOU --> This does not affect use of "Van Bergen" when that is quoted 
        directly from a source.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>2012/03/15</h2>

        revised affected indexes and regional locator maps accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <!-- fixed typo and #nn refs in EUGreatBellsByCountry; +3 BE... -->
        Provided a new index to the work of the <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IXfoundryMichaux.html">Michaux bellfoundry</a>, containing entries
        which were formerly in the index to the work of <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IXfdyMisc.html">miscellaneous bellfoundries</a>; revised 
        affected regional indexes accordingly.&nbsp; This new index is complete with respect to the underlying database.
        <!-- 12/03/12 - reloaded yesterday's changes, which in the second pass had somehow gotten put into the root directory 
             instead of /data/ 
        -->
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>2012/03/11</h2>
      <p>
        Added two <a href="/towerbells-web/data/EUGreatBellsByCountry.html#NL">great bells in the Netherlands</a>
        <!-- 12/02/22 - fixed state indexing for NCBCRKBC.HTM -->

      </p>
      <p>
        Provided a new index to the work of the <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IXfoundryCausard.html">Causard bellfoundries</a>, containing entries
        which were formerly in the index to the work of <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IXfdyMisc.html">miscellaneous bellfoundries</a>; revised 
        affected regional indexes accordingly.&nbsp; This new index is complete with respect to the underlying database.
      </p>
      <p>
        Corrected the location of the lost chime of <a href="/towerbells-web/data/NA_no_more.html#PHSI">St.Simeon's Church, Philadelphia</a>
        (and the reason for its loss), upon discovering that the recorded denomination of the church was wrong and had been 
        pointing researchers to the wrong location.
      </p>
      <p>
        Provided missing back-links to year-of-completion index for 34 North American non-traditional carillons (not listed 
        here).
      </p>
      <p>
        Added remote Weblinks to 27 assorted site data pages (not listed here because the database was not changed).

        <!-- or <A href="/towerbells-web/atlas/GoogleRegionalMapGCNA.html?IX120201">map</A> -->
        revised affected indexes and regional locator maps accordingly.&nbsp;This update completes the foundry indexes for 
        <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IXfoundryBollee.html">Boll&eacute;e</a> (France), 
        <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IXfoundrySergeys.html">Sergeys</a> (Belgium) and 
        <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IXfoundryTaylor.html">Taylor</a> (England), 
        at least with respect to the underlying database.&nbsp; (It is quite possible that additional carillon and chime work 
        by Boll&eacute;e and Sergeys remains to be discovered.)
        <!-- fixed missing foundry names in IXfdyMisc -->
        <!-- very minor wordsmithing in IX-BellfoundriesAdvice -->
        <!-- minor editorial fixes to 10 Belgian site data pages -->
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>2012/02/02</h2>
      <p>
        Revised 22 site data pages (see <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IX120120.HTM">list</a>);

      </p>
      <p>
        <!-- expanded the history of BOSTON - FCC in IXNAmulti -->
        In the Asia &amp; Pacific Rim region, corrected index references to the 5 chimolas (chimes of hemispherical bells),
        expanded mentions of 5- and 6-bell rings, and added suburban cross-referencing in major metropolitan area.
        <!-- fixed very bad text in IXAPSMcs -->
        <!-- Revised Glossary(2) and maintenance to mention 5- & 6-bell rings in Africa -->
      </p>
      <p>
        Added a Note to those bellfoundry indexes which are still incomplete because many known instruments remain to be added
        for Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands.&nbsp; Bellfoundry indexes without such a note may be presumed to be 
        complete with respect to the underlying database, though unreported work may still exist.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>2012/01/31</h2>
      <p>
        Revised 30 site data pages and added one (see <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IX111226.HTM">list</a>);

        been dispersed; deleted the site data page for <a href="/towerbells-web/data/NA_no_more.html#PHSI">St.Simeon Lutheran Church, Philadelphia 
        PA</a> upon confirmation that the building which once held the bells no longer exists; replaced each with a paragraph 
        on the page of "sites that are no more" (follow links above); revised affected indexes and regional locator maps 
        accordingly.&nbsp;
        <!-- supplied 4 missing database refs in EU_no_more -->
        <!-- supplied missing internal link in IXNANTLGsp -->
        <!-- revised 5 area index lists for consistency of terminology -->
