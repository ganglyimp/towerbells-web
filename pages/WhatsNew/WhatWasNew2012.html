						<a href="/towerbells-web/pages/WhatsNew/WhatIsNew.html">"What's New"</a> page to a manageable size.&nbsp; The changes 
						are reported in reverse order, with the latest at the top.&nbsp; Dates of entries show when pages were

				</section>
				<!-- 12/11/28 - fixed encoding error in IXNAspCombined, probably resulting from using G4 for upload instead of 9600, by reloading from 9600. -->

					</p>
				</section>
				<!-- 12/09/12 - fixed wording error in RHMaylandBio -->

						<!-- fixed typo in APGreatBellsW -->
						Added new page listing all <a href="/towerbells-web/data/TU_ixs.html">tubular tower chime indexes</a>, linked from the

						<a href="/towerbells-web/pages/TubularBells/TubularBells.html">Tubular Bells page</a>, so that site data pages of all kinds can 
						now be found from one place.&nbsp; Revised the Tubular Bells page to use the new page instead of listing

						<a href="/towerbells-web/pages/WhatsNew/NewsHistoryTB.html">What was new in these pages before the merger?</a>, covering the years

						accordingly.<!-- Feedback, SurveyForms -->
					</p>
					<p>
						Removed BabelFish translation tool from home page after discovering that it is no longer available.&nbsp;
						<!-- + other editorial tweaks --> (Apparently Microsoft bought AltaVista and shut down this utility in favor of 
						their own translation utility, but failed to provide an adequate link to it for users of AltaVista.)&nbsp;

						Created a new ultra-combined <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IXNAspCombined.html">North American geographical index</a> which 
						includes both conventional and tubular instruments.&nbsp; (For the moment, there is no corresponding map, and 
						this index can be reached only from the home page.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Fixed a mapping problem by changing the "allowed referers" list for the Google Maps API key.&nbsp; Maps had
						been working for visitors who accessed this Website as "www.towerbells.org" but not for those who accessed it

				<section>
					<h1 id="2012-04-18">2012/04/18 - Status Change</h1>
					<p>
						As of today, the cleanup of broken internal links and other infelicities which resulted from the Website 
						merger (see 2012/04/02 below) is complete, and a new maintenance baseline for TowerBells.org has been 
						established.&nbsp; Henceforth, no distinction will be made between updates to the ex-GCNA pages of this 
						Website and those to the pre-merger TowerBells pages, and so the <a href="/towerbells-web/data/Whats_New.html">data-level What's New page</a>
						will no longer report changes to the ex-GCNA pages.&nbsp;

					<p>Commented out links for MapsOnUs site locator maps, which are no longer available.</p>
					<p>Repaired several broken internal links.</p>
					<p>
						Revised references and links to the GCNA Website to reflect the move of the Data section from that Website to 
						here.&nbsp; Pages affected by this change have not had their internal dates of revision changed unless there 
						was unrelated substantive change.
					</p>
					<p>
						Renamed MapUse.html to MapUseT.html as an interim measure to avoid conflict with the similarly-named file 
						being merged into this Website.
					</p>
					<p>Renamed ZAPRTRCH.HTM to ZAPRTRC1.HTM</p>
					<p>
						Supplied a new home page to connect the "old" TowerBells section with the ex-GCNA section.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Activated the re-hosted Website at its new location (Web hosting company GoDaddy.com).</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Henceforth this page will report all changes to the Website except those few which apply only to the ex-GCNA 
						section in the course of integrating the two sections.&nbsp; Those will be reported on the migrated 
						<a href="/towerbells-web/pages/WhatsNew/Whats_New.html">What's&nbsp;New</a> page in that section.&nbsp; (NOTE:&nbsp; This dual reporting
