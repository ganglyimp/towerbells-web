<h1>What was new in these pages?</h1>
This page reports on the evolution of this Website during the year 2012.&nbsp;
This helps to keep the <A HREF="WhatIsNew.html">"What's New"</A> 
page to a manageable size.&nbsp; 
The changes are reported in reverse order, with the latest at the top.&nbsp; 
Dates of entries show when pages were installed on the Web server, 
which is not always the same as their internal dates of revision.&nbsp;

so that site data pages of all kinds can now be found from one place.&nbsp;

Removed BabelFish translation tool from home page after discovering that it is
no longer available.&nbsp;<!-- + other editorial tweaks -->

in favor of their own translation utility, but failed to provide
an adequate link to it for users of AltaVista.)&nbsp;

for the Google Maps API key.&nbsp;
Maps had been working for visitors who accessed this Website as "www.towerbells.org"

Revised 103 site data pages which had obsolete (but still functional) 
MapQuest locator map links.&nbsp;
The principal effect is to restore place names to the generated map pages.
<p>
<b>2012/04/18 - Status change:</b>
As of today, the cleanup of broken internal links and other infelicities which resulted
from the Website merger (see 2012/04/02 below) is complete, 
and a new maintenance baseline for TowerBells.org has been established.&nbsp;
Henceforth, no distinction will be made between updates 
to the ex-GCNA pages of this Website and those to the pre-merger TowerBells pages, 
and so the 
<a href="data/Whats_New.html">data-level What's New page</a>
will no longer report changes to the ex-GCNA pages.&nbsp;
<p>
The "Direction" note block which used to float in that news page has been moved here.

Fixed a few longstanding broken links, hitherto undetected.

<b>2012/04/16 - </b>
Added robots.txt file to restrict access by Web crawlers slightly.
<p>
<b>2012/04/15 - </b>

for instruments made of conventional bells (formerly on the GCNA Website but now here).

<br>
Removed update lists and map links prior to 2010 from this page.

Added Search link to home page.
<p>
<b>2012/04/04 - </b>
Fixed several links which had been incorrectly modified for the merger.

in both the tubular tower chimes and ex-GCNA sections.

<br>
Repaired several broken internal links.

of the Data section from that Website to here.&nbsp; 
Pages affected by this change have not had their
internal dates of revision changed unless there was unrelated substantive change.
<br>
Renamed MapUse.html to MapUseT.html as an interim measure to avoid conflict with the
similarly-named file being merged into this Website.
<br>
Renamed ZAPRTRCH.HTM to ZAPRTRC1.HTM<br>
<p>
Supplied a new home page to connect the "old" TowerBells section 
with the ex-GCNA section.
<p>
<b>Activated the re-hosted Website at its new location 
(Web hosting company GoDaddy.com).</b>
<br>
Henceforth this page will report all changes to the Website 
except those few which apply only to the ex-GCNA section 
in the course of integrating the two sections.&nbsp;
Those will be reported on the migrated 
<a href="data/Whats_New.html">What's&nbsp;New</a> page in that section.&nbsp;
(NOTE:&nbsp; This dual reporting ceased as of 2012/04/18 - see above.)
<p>
<b>2012/04/01 - Status change:</b>
News items of earlier date (see below) apply only to the original version 
of the TowerBells Website, i.e., during the period when it was maintained separately
from what was until today the data segment of the GCNA Website (www.gcna.org/data,
which no longer exists).
