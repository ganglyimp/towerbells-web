				<A HREF="WhatIsNew.html">"What's New"</A> page to a manageable size.&nbsp; The changes are reported in 
				reverse order, with the latest at the top.&nbsp; Dates of entries show when pages were installed on the 
				Web server, which is not always the same as their internal dates of revision.&nbsp;

				NOTE: Most of the revised tubular chime pages now have site locator map links, but these are based on recovered

				be improved in the next batch of revisions.
			</p>

				Added new page listing all <a href="data/TU_ixs.html">tubular tower chime indexes</a>, linked from the 
				<a href="data/Data_Top.html">Data Top page</a>, replicating those formerly listed in the 
				<a href="../TubularBells/TubularBells.html">Tubular Bells page</a>, so that site data pages of all kinds can 
				now be found from one place.&nbsp; Revised the Tubular Bells page to use the new page instead of listing 
				individual indexes.&nbsp; This is a major step in the integration of the previous version of this Website
				with the data migrated from the GCNA Website.

				<A HREF="NewsHistoryTB.html">What was new in these pages before the merger?</A>, covering the years 2000-2012;

			</p>
			<p>
				Relocated PDFs for tubular chimes together with those for conventional instruments, revising links 
				accordingly.<!-- Feedback, SurveyForms -->
			</p>
			<p>
				Removed BabelFish translation tool from home page after discovering that it is no longer available.&nbsp;
				<!-- + other editorial tweaks --> (Apparently Microsoft bought AltaVista and shut down this utility in favor of 
				their own translation utility, but failed to provide an adequate link to it for users of AltaVista.)&nbsp;

				this index can be reached only from the home page.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Fixed a mapping problem by changing the "allowed referers" list for the Google Maps API key.&nbsp; Maps had
				been working for visitors who accessed this Website as "www.towerbells.org" but not for those who accessed it 
				as "towerbells.org".&nbsp;

			<p>
				As of today, the cleanup of broken internal links and other infelicities which resulted from the Website 
				merger (see 2012/04/02 below) is complete, and a new maintenance baseline for TowerBells.org has been 
				established.&nbsp; Henceforth, no distinction will be made between updates to the ex-GCNA pages of this 
				Website and those to the pre-merger TowerBells pages, and so the <a href="data/Whats_New.html">data-level What's New page</a>
				will no longer report changes to the ex-GCNA pages.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>The "Direction" note block which used to float in that news page has been moved here.</p>

			<p>
				Supplied a new home page to connect the "old" TowerBells section with the ex-GCNA section.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Activated the re-hosted Website at its new location (Web hosting company GoDaddy.com).</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Henceforth this page will report all changes to the Website except those few which apply only to the ex-GCNA 
				section in the course of integrating the two sections.&nbsp; Those will be reported on the migrated 
				<a href="data/Whats_New.html">What's&nbsp;New</a> page in that section.&nbsp; (NOTE:&nbsp; This dual reporting 
				ceased as of 2012/04/18 - see above.)
			</p>

		<section>
			<h2>2012/04/01 - Status change:</h2>
			<p>
				News items of earlier date (see below) apply only to the original version of the TowerBells Website, i.e.,
