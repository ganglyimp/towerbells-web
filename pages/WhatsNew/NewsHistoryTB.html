			<h1>What was new in these pages in 2000-2012?</h1>
			<p>
				This page reports on the evolution of this collection of pages prior to the merger of the data migrated 
				from the GCNA Website.&nbsp; This helps to keep the current <A HREF="WhatIsNew.html">"What's&nbsp;New" page</A>  
				to a manageable size.&nbsp; The changes are reported in reverse order, with the latest at the top.&nbsp;
				Dates show when pages were installed on the Web server, which is not always the same as their internal 
				dates of revision.  
			</p>
			<p>
				This report covers not only the root directory but all pre-merger subdirectories.
			</p>
		</header>

		<section>
			<h2>2012/04/01 - Status change:</h2>
			<p>
				News items of earlier date (see below) apply only to the original version of the TowerBells Website, i.e., 
				during the period when it was maintained separately from what was until today the data segment of the GCNA 
				Website (www.gcna.org/data, which no longer exists).
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>2011/11/22</h2>
			<p>
				Replaced Google Maps link base for 79 site data pages within the USA (not listed).&nbsp;
				(281 sites remain unmapped.)
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>2011/11/21</h2>
			<p>
				Replaced Google Maps link base for 30 site data pages outside the USA (not listed).&nbsp; (6 sites remain 
				unmapped.)
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>2011/10/24</h2>
			<p>
				Revised 5 site data pages for tubular chimes and added one (see <A HREF="data/IX101024TU.HTM">list</A>
				or <A HREF="http://www.towerbells.org/data/maps/GoogleRegionalMapTB.html?XM101024">map</A>); revised affected 
				indexes and regional maps accordingly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Revised the page of <a href="data/TU_no_more.html">sites that are no more</a> to reflect discovery of the 
				origin of the Deagan chime stored at the Avril Company in Cincinnati; revised affected indexes accordingly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fixed all broken regional maps by replacing Google API key.&nbsp; The previous version of the key was valid 
				only for the URL which was in use prior to the 03/22 relocation of this Website (see below). <BR/>
				Also replaced Google Maps API key for individual locator maps; but all pages containing such maps also require 
				MapQuest link changes, and only the pages in this update have those maps fixed.&nbsp; About 90 others require 
				updating.&nbsp; (The reason for the MapQuest link change is explained
				<a href="data/Whats_New.html">on the ex-GCNA side of this Website</a> - see 2010/10/01 & 05 there.)
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>2011/03/22</h2>
			<p>
				Migrated this Website from home.swbell.net/csz_stl/ to homepage.mac.com/stlbells/TowerBells/, because AT&T 
				will be terminating the former service on 1 June.&nbsp; What made the change more urgent was that its warning 
				popup was incompatible with the existing aliasing of towerbells.org, causing the site to be inaccessible via
				some Web browsers.
