				<A HREF="WhatIsNew.html">"What's New"</A> page to a manageable size.&nbsp; The changes are reported in 
				reverse order, with the latest at the top.&nbsp; Dates of entries show when pages were installed on the 
				Web server, which is not always the same as their internal dates of revision.

				<b>NOTE:</b>&nbsp; This update package was in preparation in early June, but its completion was delayed by 
				travel to the annual Congress of The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America (GCNA) and to the triennial 
				congress of the World Carillon Federation (WCF); the latter trip supplied additional information that 
				affected items already in the package, thus delaying completion even further.&nbsp; (Other information 
				acquired during these travels will be included in the next update package.)

				announced recently.

				Produced up-to-date versions of most <A HREF="data/Hardcopy.html">PDFs for hardcopy</A>, added four new files,
				and revised that page extensively.
			</p>
			<p>
				Revised the 11-bell section of the North American <A HREF="data/IXNASMnr.html">index to chimes by number of 
				bells</A> to subdivide it according to the arrangement of semitones, as the 9-bell section has been for several 
				months, and as the 10-bell section was recently done.
			</p>
			<p>
				<B>NOTE:</B>&nbsp; This set of revisions was originally expected to be uploaded to the Website in late March.&nbsp;
				But a catastrophic failure of a key computer prevented that from happening.&nbsp; Determining that the computer 
				was unrepairable took weeks.&nbsp; Fortunately, a nearly identical replacement was found on eBay, and its arrival 
				early today enabled upload of these revisions to proceed.

				revised affected indexes and regional maps accordingly.&nbsp; Note that two "revised" site data pages are
