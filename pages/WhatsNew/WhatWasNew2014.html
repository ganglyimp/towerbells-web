						<b>NOTE:</b>&nbsp; This update package was in preparation in early June, but its completion was delayed by 
						travel to the annual Congress of The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America (GCNA) and to the triennial 
						congress of the World Carillon Federation (WCF); the latter trip supplied additional information that 
						affected items already in the package, thus delaying completion even further.&nbsp; (Other information 
						acquired during these travels will be included in the next update package.)

					<p>
						<!-- made Belgian links to VBV Website more consistent -->
						Revised the foundry histories for <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IXfoundryEijsbouts.html#HISTORY">Eijsbouts</a> and 
						<a href="/towerbells-web/data/IXfoundryPetitFritsen.html#HISTORY">Petit &amp; Fritsen</a> to reflect the merger that was

						months, and as the 10-bell section was recently done.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>NOTE:</b>&nbsp; This set of revisions was originally expected to be uploaded to the Website in late March.&nbsp;
						But a catastrophic failure of a key computer prevented that from happening.&nbsp; Determining that the computer 
						was unrepairable took weeks.&nbsp; Fortunately, a nearly identical replacement was found on eBay, and its arrival 
						early today enabled upload of these revisions to proceed.

						<!-- or <A HREF="/data/maps/GoogleRegionalMapTB.html?XM140102">map of tubular chimes</A>); -->
						revised affected indexes and regional maps accordingly.&nbsp; Note that two "revised" site data pages are
