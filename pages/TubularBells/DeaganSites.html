			<h1>Deagan Tower Tube Installations</h1>
			<p>
				The J.C.Deagan Company produced about 440 tower tube instruments over a span of nearly 40 years.&nbsp;
				(The exact number of installations is uncertain because of enlargements, removals, replacements and
				relocations during that period.)&nbsp; The three tables below show the 426 instruments listed by the
				company at the time they ceased operations, plus 13 others known to have been installed.&nbsp;
				<i>
					It does not show the present locations of systems which have been relocated to other institutions by
					someone other than Deagan.&nbsp; For those, you must see the
					<a href="/data/IXTUmakerDeagan.html">Deagan site index</a> which parallels this page, or the
					<a href="/pages/TubularBells/TubularBells.html#PDFs">complete site list</a>.
				</i>

		<section>
			<p>
				The <a href="#USA">first table</A> below shows institutions in the USA, the <a href="#CANADA">second</a>
				shows institutions in Canada, and the <a href="#FOREIGN">third</a> shows those in other foreign
				countries.&nbsp; Within each table, sites are listed by geographic region (state, province or country),
				then by city, then by name of the institution (either as of the time of original installation or as of
				the latest Deagan record, or both).&nbsp; The TONES column shows the number of tones (notes) in the
				instrument, and the YEAR column shows when the instrument was installed (or when it was expanded to its
				final size); in some cases initial and intermediate sizes and years are also shown.&nbsp; The
				institutional name changes shown presumably were recorded before the Deagan Company ceased operations in
				this market.&nbsp; For instruments relocated by Deagan (or with Deagan's knowledge), these tables show
				both the initial and final location and installation dates; the initial location has status "Relocated
				*" (see below) and the final location has "-R" attached to the year.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most information in the first five columns of each table is based primarily on three surviving Deagan
				company installation record books, as follows:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A nearly complete book kept by long-time Deagan employee June Albright; it is now in the custody of
					Ed Gaida, who transcribed selected items of information from it into a
					<!-- <a href="http://www.edgaida.com/deagan10.html"> -->list.&nbsp;
					Unfortunately, that list is no longer available on the Web, and it cannot be reproduced directly
					because of copyright issues.
				</li>
				<li>
					A partial book kept by Roy Lofink, one of Deagan's principal tower chime installers; it was
					inherited by his son and transcribed in full by his grandson.&nbsp; This book contains records of
					almost all of Roy's installations, plus a few others.
				</li>
				<li>
					A partial book kept by Clarence J. Gercken, another of Deagan's principal tower chime installers; it
					was inherited by his son.&nbsp; This book contains records for almost all known installations in the
					northeastern third of the country, plus a few installations of Celesta-Vox and Celesta-Chime
					instruments (Deagan's early ventures into electronic tower systems) in the same region.&nbsp; It
					also contains hand-written annotations, from which it can be inferred that it was used for about
					a year by someone who was doing maintenance work and arranging for maintenance contracts on Deagan
					tower chimes in the late 1950s.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Information in the BY column shows which of Deagan's known tower chime installers performed the
				work.&nbsp; This was initially obtained from the Lofink and Gercken books, and was supplemented by Jack
				Gercken based on an archive of correspondence between Clarence Gercken and his wife when he was away
				from home.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>Abbreviations for installers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>FBL = Fred B. Little &nbsp; (at least 6.5 jobs, 1920-1926)</li>
				<li>CJL = Charles J. Lustig &nbsp; (at least 81 jobs, 1920-1930)</li>
				<li>RL = Roy Lofink &nbsp; (155.5 jobs, 1923-1941)</li>
				<li>CJG = Clarence J. Gercken, Sr. &nbsp; (111 jobs, 1926-1964)</li>
				<li>JG = Clarence J. (Jack) Gercken, Jr. &nbsp; (1953-1965)</li>
				<li>ELR = E. L. Russell &nbsp; (at least 2 jobs, 1929-1930)</li>
				<li>HGS = H. G. Schluter &nbsp; (at least 2 jobs, 1935-1936)</li>
				<li>RGH = Roy G. Hultman &nbsp; (at least 3 jobs, 1946-1947)</li>
				<li>(N/R) = Not recorded by Deagan (at least 3 jobs)</li>
				<li>? = unknown &nbsp; (over 97 jobs)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The total job count exceeds the number of instruments because original installations, enlargements,
				replacements and relocations by Deagan are all counted.&nbsp; The unknowns are those sites that are not
				described in either the Lofink book or the Gercken book.
			</p>
			<p>
				Information in the STATUS column, together with information in <i>italics</i> in the other columns, was
				obtained from other sources.&nbsp; STATUS indications for instruments are as follows (counts in
				parentheses):
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Operable (102) = exists and can be used (even if it isn't)</li>
				<li>Dead (73) = exists but needs repairs to become operable</li>
				<li>Partial (12) = exists, some controls or notes usable, others need repair</li>
				<li>Stored (9) = taken down, but still kept by original or present owner</li>
				<li>Extant (40) = believed to exist but its condition is unknown</li>
				<p>
					<li>
						&nbsp; /altered (18) = may be operable, dead or extant, as indicated; <br />
						Deagan strikers and/or some controls have been replaced with other equipment.
					</li>
					<li>
						Relocated (28) = was moved (sold or given) to another institution (identification not given
						here, but can be found by following the Status link), where it possibly survives.&nbsp; If
						marked with an asterisk (*), the relocation was either done by or known to Deagan, and its
						destination and current status appear elsewhere on this page.&nbsp; Otherwise, the current
						status at the destination is also shown if known; if not, it is presumed extant.
					</li>
				</p>
				<p>
					<li>Removed (13) = was taken down, possibly sold; components may survive</li>
					<li>Replaced (17) = was replaced by a different tower instrument; disposition unknown</li>
					<li>Scrapped (25) = was removed and discarded or sold as junk, possibly during replacement</li>
					<li>Demolished (2) = was destroyed by human action</li>
					<li>Destroyed (14) = was destroyed by fire or other disaster</li>
					<li>Disappeared (9) = fate unknown, though the building survives</li>
					<li>
						Gone (21) = The institution or building no longer exists, so the instrument is presumed to have
						been demolished, destroyed or scrapped
					</li>
				</p>
				<p>
					<li>blank or ? (question mark) = status is unknown</li>
					<li><i>Other status indications are self-explanatory.</i></li>
				</p>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The status word or "?" may also be a link to further information on the current status or year of loss,
				in the form of a page or paragraph about the instrument.&nbsp; Similar information may be found in the
				<a href="TubularBells.html#PDFs">complete site list</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				SUMMARY: <br />
				More than 230 tower chimes survive, in various conditions. <br />
				More than 90 tower chimes have been lost for various reasons. <br />
				The status of the remaining 120 or so tower chimes is uncertain at this time. <br />
				A parallel page summarizes the
				<a href="/pages/TubularBells/DeaganSummary.html">current status by state</a>.

				<B>NOTE: Dead instruments can usually be resurrected.</B>&nbsp; The tubular bells are essentially
				unaffected by exposure to weather in the belfry.&nbsp; The timber racks on which they hang are simple in
				design, and are easily repaired or rebuilt if badly weathered (though that is uncommon).&nbsp; The
				mechanical equipment is sturdy, and typically needs only minor adjustment and lubrication from time to
				time.&nbsp; The electrical wiring and related components are the parts most likely to need refurbishing,
				but the expertise to do that does exist.&nbsp; Replacement equipment, additional controls or even
				complete installations can be obtained using material that was removed from other institutions.&nbsp;
