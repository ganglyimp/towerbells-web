						Large tubular bells, cast from a material that is superficially similar to conventional tower
						bells or drawn (extruded) from similar metal, have been used to make tower music or to serve as
						bells for tower clocks.&nbsp; The largest such tubes weigh hundreds of pounds.&nbsp; Such bells
						are not to be confused with orchestral tubular bells (often found also in pipe organs) nor with
						the smaller tubular bells found in some longcase ("grandfather") clocks, even though some
						manufacturers might have supplied all of these markets.&nbsp; (In fact, the first use of tubular
						bells in America was for longcase clocks, and tower tubes were an outgrowth of that use.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Tower chimes made of these tubular bells appeared in both England and the USA in the late 19th
						century.&nbsp; More than 200 were made in England, though not much is yet known about them; at
						least four were exported to North America.&nbsp; The early American tubular tower chimes never
						became popular--only a few are known, and not much has been discovered about their makers.&nbsp;
						An early 20th century American manufacturer was much more successful, producing more than 400,
						many of which still survive in operation.

					<p>
						Tubular bells may have been used in France as early as the 1850s or 1860s.&nbsp; But in the
						English-speaking world, they got their start when John Harrington, of Coventry, Warwickshire,
						England, patented a clock-chime of tubular bells in that country in 1884.&nbsp; It was an
						immediate success, winning gold medals at Paris in 1885 and at Liverpool in 1886.&nbsp; Within a
						few years, Harrington's tubular bells were being used in England in both hall clocks and bell
						towers.&nbsp; (Different sized tubes were used for these different applications, of course.)
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1886, Walter H. Durfee, an antiques dealer from Providence, Rhode Island, USA, met Harrington
						while on a business trip to England.&nbsp; Durfee had recently begun importing English longcase
						(or hall) clocks to the USA, while Harrington was a partner in Harris &amp; Harrington, sales
						representatives for a London clock maker, J.J. Elliot, Ltd.&nbsp; Durfee and Harrington saw
						the possibility of using Harrington's tubes as clock bells, and soon Elliot was producing clock
						movements that could be used with Harrington tubular bells in longcase clocks.&nbsp; Durfee
						began importing these movements and bells to the USA and assembling them into high-quality cases
						which he manufactured.&nbsp; (Some are quite valuable today.)
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1887, Harrington obtained the first American patent for a clock chime apparatus, and assigned
						it to Walter H. Durfee.&nbsp; (For more information about this and other patents referenced
						below, see the separate page on
						<a href="/towerbells-web/pages/TubularBells/TubularBellPatents.html">Tubular Bell Patents</a>.)&nbsp; In the
						same year, Durfee sold his first chiming longcase clock.&nbsp; With the protection of this
						patent, Durfee had an American monopoly on clocks with tubular chimes.
					</p>
					<p>
						An early account states that "An exhibition of Tubular Bells was given at Providence, R.I. on
						October fourth and fifth, 1888.&nbsp; It was the first exhibition of these bells ever given in
						the United States, and was largely attended during the two days, enlisting special attention
						from prominent architects, builders and churchmen."&nbsp; Undoubtedly this exhibition was put on
						by Durfee, with support from Harrington.&nbsp; Publicity about this exhibition may have led to a
						visit to Providence by the Dean of General Theological Seminary, who later that year gave the
						Harrington/Durfee chime which still resides in the tower of the chapel of that seminary.&nbsp;
						It is not yet known whether this exhibition was held at the Providence church where a tubular
						tower chime had been installed some time before the Dean's visit.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the same year, John Harrington obtained another American patent, which was also assigned to
						Durfee.
					</p>
					<p>
						An 1890 advertisement for tubular bells states that the [English] patent was held by Harrington,
						Latham &amp; Co. of Coventry, "Sole Manufacturers," and that "Over 100 Sets have been now
						erected."&nbsp; It also stated that the U.S.A. patents were controlled by Walter H. Durfee.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next milestone appears to have occurred in 1896, when James E. Treat, of Boston,
						Massachusetts, USA, received an American patent for a tubular bell which was reinforced by an
						annular ring inside and/or outside of the top edge.&nbsp; Treat was an organ builder, and at
						about this time was managing the Methuen Organ Company, so it is possible that this patent was
						related to the use of tubular bells in pipe organs.&nbsp; However, the patent was assigned to
						the United States Tubular Bell Company (see below), of which Walter H. Durfee was the president,
						and which shared the building occupied by the Methuen Organ Company.&nbsp; So this event may
						also indicate that about this time Durfee stopped importing Harrington's tubular bells and began
						manufacturing his own, via the U.S. Tubular channel.&nbsp; That hypothesis is supported by the
						appearance of this patent date on a set of four 1.5-inch tubular bells in a house chime.&nbsp;
						Each tube bears the name of Walter H. Durfee &amp; Company, Providence, RI (abbreviated,
						un-spaced and un-punctuated) along with four patent dates, the last of which corresponds to this
						patent.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1900, Allen W. Harrington obtained an American patent for an improved design of tubular bell
						for chiming clocks.&nbsp; A.W.Harrington was a U.S. citizen, residing in New York City, and the
						patent was assigned to Harris &amp; Harrington, of the same city.&nbsp; Undoubtedly this was an
						American office of Harris &amp; Harrington of Coventry, England, so it appears that the
						Harrington firm was now bypassing Durfee to sell directly into the American market.&nbsp;
						However, it is not yet clear whether that market was for tower chimes, clock chimes, or
						both.&nbsp; It's also possible that Harris &amp; Harrington were selling only non-longcase
						clocks, so as not to be competing with Durfee.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 1901, Allen Wardner Harrington obtained another American patent related to tubular bells for
						chiming clocks.&nbsp; As in the case of his previous patent, this one was assigned to Harris
						&amp; Harrington.
					</p>
					<p>
						Perhaps spurred by the successes of Durfee and the Harringtons, others were now at work in the
						field.&nbsp; In 1900, Rowland H. Mayland of Freeport, NY obtained an American patent for a clock
						chime.&nbsp; The following year, Charles A. Jacques of New York City obtained an American patent
						for a clock-chime, and another for a tubular bell of different shape.&nbsp; All three of these
						patents were assigned to Bawo &amp; Dotter, who were clockmakers in New York City, but
						were also described as "a corporation of New Jersey."&nbsp; Any or all of these patents may have
						formed part of the basis of a lawsuit by Durfee against Bawo in 1902, on the grounds of patent
						infringement.&nbsp; Durfee lost the lawsuit, and with it his American monopoly on tubular clock
						chimes.&nbsp; Afterward, many other American clockmakers began producing longcase clocks with
						tubular chimes of their own design, and Durfee's production of such clocks declined.&nbsp; Other
						patents were later issued for a variety of other improvements to clock chime mechanisms; all
						were assigned to various clock making companies.&nbsp; But none of the other clockmakers are
						known to have followed Durfee (and U.S. Tubular Bell Co.) into the field of tower chimes.
					</p>
					<p>
						John C. Deagan of Chicago, Illinois, USA patented various musical instruments based on tubular
						resonators between 1900 and 1913, though no patent has yet been found that relates directly to
						the large tubes which he began using for tower chimes about 1916.&nbsp; But in 1920, Leonard D.
						Morris of Chicago patented a chime mounting in which reference is made to "the proper guiding of
						dampers for the mounted chimes".&nbsp; And in 1928, Frederick E. Little of Chicago obtained a
						patent for a "musical sound-producing instrument" which involves both a horizontal electric
						striker and a vertical electric damper above the top of a sound-producing cylindrical bar.&nbsp;
						This patent was assigned to the Deagan company, which employed Fred Little, and clearly is
						applicable to the type of tower chimes which Deagan was already installing (though all known
						dampers in Deagan tower chimes were located below the tubes).&nbsp;
					</p>

						Only three of these are actually known to have contained one or more added semitones (12+1,
						10+3, 10+1).&nbsp; While the three other 13-note instruments are probably similar, all those of
						10 notes or less are almost certainly purely diatonic in nature.&nbsp; Furthermore, there is
						evidence that the typical way of arranging the taut-rope chiming rack for playing these
						instruments was with the treble note at the left end, with the notes being numbered in
						change-ringing fashion - treble to tenor, left to right.&nbsp; This is exactly opposite to what
						a keyoard-trained musician would expect, and so it seems highly probable that these instruments
						were designed primarly to enable the chiming of changes, in imitation of what would have been
						heard regularly from most nearby towers containing conventional bells hung for change
						ringing.&nbsp; The single instance of an 11-note chime actually corroborates this idea, because
						its one added semitone was not installed until 40 years after the original diatonic ten.
					</p>
					<p>
						A list of <a href="http://kent.lovesguide.com/tubularbells.php">tubular chimes in Kent</a>
						(England) includes a drawing of a Harrington tower chime installation.&nbsp; That drawing makes
						clear that these were manually operated instruments, probably equipped with a simple taut-rope
						rack for the chimer's use.&nbsp; That list identifies 13 present or former tower tube
						instruments in a single county of England; they are dated from 1888 to c.1930, and range in size
						from 5 to 11 tubes.

							were restored in 1947, but then sold in 1968 to help fund the acquisition of the first six
							of the present eight conventional bells.&nbsp; The tubes ranged in weight from 63 to 151

						<h2 id="Durfee">Durfee</h2>
						<b class="heading heading-3">Providence, Rhode Island, USA;&nbsp; 1888?-1925?</b>
					</span>

					<p>
						Starting in 1885, <b>Walter H. Durfee</b> singlehandedly resurrected the U.S. market for
						longcase clocks, using mechanisms which he imported from English clockmakers.&nbsp; These clocks
						had been popularized by Henry C. Work's song, "Grandfather's Clock" (1876; see
						<a href="http://www.theclockdepot.com/history_of_the_grandfather_clock.html">story</a> and
						<a href="http://www.personalposters.com/clocks/antstand.htm">lyrics</a>),
						<!-- Another version: http://www.clockowner.com/the-grandfather-clock/ -->
						from which the term "grandfather clock" came to describe what had previously been called "hall"
						or "longcase" clocks.&nbsp; Durfee built tubular chimes of four to nine notes into many of these
						clocks.&nbsp; (Previously, this type of clock only struck the hour, and sometimes also the half
						hour, on a single gong or small hemispherical bell.)&nbsp; The tubes in these chimes were four
						to seven feet long, and somewhat more than an inch in diameter.&nbsp; Initially these
						were imported from <a href="#HAR">Harrington</a> of England (see above), for whom Durfee was the
						sole American licensee and distributor.&nbsp; But eventually some of these clock chimes were
						made in America based on Durfee's own patent.&nbsp; In 1902, Durfee lost a lawsuit related to
						these patents (see above), and therefore lost his monopoly on the sale and distribution of
						tubular clock chimes in America.
					</p>
					<p>
						Durfee's clock-making business is well known to horologists, but his tower chime business is
						still somewhat of a mystery.&nbsp; For example, it isn't yet clear what the connection was
						between the tower chimes made by Durfee and those made by <a href="#UST">U.S.Tubular</a> (see
						below), to whom Durfee licensed the right to manufacture tubular bells of two inches or more in
						diameter.&nbsp; On the one hand, Walter H. Durfee was certainly the first importer of
						tubular bells to the USA, and tower chimes are known to bear his name.&nbsp; (The oldest
						surviving tubular chime known in North America, that of General Theological Seminary in New York
						City, was installed in 1888 by <b>Walter H. Durfee &amp; Co.</b> using tubular bells imported
						from Harrington's firm in England.)&nbsp; On the other hand, he was also the president of
						U.S. Tubular Bell Company for at least part of its existence, and the relative time spans of the
						two firms appear to have overlapped considerably.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some time after 1900, Durfee produced a publicity booklet which described the uses of Durfee
						Tubular Bells for "tower chimes, breakfast calls, stage and organ chimes, and chiming hall
						clocks."&nbsp; Included is a sketch of a two-note "ding dong" which used exactly the same
						mechanism as his 15-note chimes.&nbsp; Other text shows that he considered making four-note
						peals, as well as chimes of 8, 13 or 15 bells.&nbsp; Not mentioned there, but found to exist, is
						a five-note tower clock chime which strikes the familiar Cambridge (or Westminster)
						quarters.&nbsp; Durfee didn't provide the tower clock, but he must have provided the
						counter-balanced levers for the simple interface between the clock action and the chime
						action.&nbsp; That tower clock chime is the only Durfee installation inspected to date which has
						a frame made for fewer than 15 notes; this leads to the conclusion that Durfee minimized his
						manufacturing costs by using just a few standard designs.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is known that Durfee was personally involved in installing several tower chimes in 1910-11,
						with the assistance of one helper.&nbsp; This might be an indication that by this date his
						longcase clock business had shrunk to the point where it was a minor part of his activities, if
						indeed it still existed at all.&nbsp; Durfee's own tubular tower chime business was sold to
						<a href="#MCS">McShane</a> (below) by 1925.

					<p>
						The American-made tubular tower chimes from both Durfee (see above) and U.S.Tubular (see below)
						are typically both distinctly similar to and distinctly different from the English-made chimes
						from Harrington (see above).&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
						Similarities:
					<ul>
						<li>Composed of heavy brass or bronze tubes</li>
						<li>Taut-rope chiming rack for operation</li>
						<li>Bottom-pivoted hammers with direction-reversing transmission</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						Differences:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Left-right arrangement of notes on rack:&nbsp; treble to bass in England, bass to treble in
							America
						</li>
						<li>
							American chimes have more notes (almost always with 15-note racks and frames) and more added
							semitones; none are purely diatonic.
						</li>
						<li>
							British chiming racks use numbers, while American chiming racks use note names.
						</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						It is notable that chimes by Durfee and UST were typically arranged with the treble note at the
						right end, as musicians would expect.&nbsp; All of those which we have inspected are
						non-transposing instruments with the same starting note - A natural.

						The <b>United States Tubular Bell Company</b> was one of several commercial ventures by

							United States Tubular Bell Company
						</a>
						occupied a wooden factory building on the north bank of the Spicket River, originally built as a

						Walter H. Durfee (see above) was president of this firm, which sold tubular tower chimes to
						churches and universities throughout the country.&nbsp; An advertisement for its tubular bells
						("Harrington Patents; For Churches, Turret Clocks, Public Buildings, Etc.") specified the same
						sizes as Durfee: "Ding-dongs, 2 bells; Peals, 4 bells; Chimes, 8, 13, and 15 bells."&nbsp;
						Unfortunately, no list of its customers has yet been found, though other evidence confirms its
						existence in 1894-6, at least.&nbsp; A few such chimes are known to bear a U.S.Tubular
						nameplate, and several others are presently attributed to this firm.&nbsp; Eventually the
						company was sold to Deagan (see below); the year of that sale is not yet known, though it may
						reasonably be presumed to have been about the time that Deagan began making tubular tower chimes

						<b>Rowland H. Mayland</b>, a manufacturer of musical instruments, produced a small number of
						tubular tower chimes late in his career.&nbsp; It is not known what prompted him to go into this
						business, nor how many such chimes he might have made.&nbsp; We have assembled a
						<a href="/towerbells-web/pages/TubularBells/RHMaylandBio.html">brief biography</a> of him based on readily
						discovered basic facts, with references to other sources of information.

					</span>

					<p>
						The <b>J.C. Deagan Company</b> was undoubtedly the largest manufacturer of tower tube
						instruments in North America.&nbsp; Before entering this field,
						<a href="http://www.pas.org/About/HOF/JCDeagan.cfm">Deagan</a> was already well known for a wide
						variety of tuned percussion instruments, mostly for use in band or orchestra.&nbsp; But the
						tower chimes which he designed are on a much larger scale.&nbsp; It has been reported that
						Deagan bought out the U.S. Tubular Bell Company (see above), but it is uncertain when that
						happened or what it might have contributed to Deagan's entry into the tower chime
						business.&nbsp; Certainly Deagan's electrical actions bear no resemblance to the mechanical
						actions of U.S.Tubular (and Durfee) tower chimes.&nbsp; The Deagan company produced about 439
						such instruments between 1916 and 1958, though there is some uncertainty in this number because
						of enlargements, buy-backs, etc.&nbsp; (See
						<a href="/towerbells-web/pages/TubularBellsDeaganSites.html">list</a> and
						<a href="/towerbells-web/pages/TubularBells/DeaganTable.html">table</a>.)
					</p>
					<p>
						The Deagan tower instruments varied in size from 1 to 97 tubes, though the maximum keyboard
						range was 32 notes.&nbsp; (Those with more than 32 tubes had multiple ranks like a pipe organ,
						with the sole exception of the 37-note set for the Wanamaker organ.)&nbsp; The deepest note
						produced was C from a tube about 12 feet long and 5 inches in diameter, weighing about 600
						pounds.&nbsp; The majority of these instruments had 10 to 16 notes, and most were installed in
						the 1920s.&nbsp; All had electric actions, with a variety of manual and/or automatic control
						mechanisms.&nbsp; Although many of these instruments have been scrapped or simply demolished
						(some being replaced with other tower instruments), some remain usable, having been repaired
						or restored in recent years.
					</p>
					<p>
						See our <a href="/towerbells-web/data/IXTUmakerDeagan.html">index</a> to pages about all of the known tubular
						tower chimes made by the J.C. Deagan Company.&nbsp; That index page also includes links to
						related material elsewhere on the World Wide Web.

					<h3 id="Deagan-Repair">Repair and Restoration</h3>
					<p>
						The <a href="http://www.deagan.com/">Top Rung Tower Chime &amp; Organ Service</a> maintains,
						repairs and restores Deagan tubular tower chimes.&nbsp; Wherever possible, authentic parts
						salvaged from other installations are used to replace components which are beyond repair.&nbsp;
						Existing chimes can also be augmented with refurbished control equipment (roll players,
						Westminster quarters, etc.).&nbsp; A few complete systems are also available for sale.
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href="http://www.williamsonwarne.com/tubular_bell.htm">Williamson-Warne &amp; Associates</a>
						also maintains, repairs and restores Deagan tubular tower chimes.&nbsp; Some replacement parts
						are available for do-it-yourself repairs (see parts list with prices on their Website).
					</p>
					<p>
						The <a href="http://www.centurymallet.com/">Century Mallet Instruments Service</a> is housed in
						part of the former Deagan factory building in Chicago, and was for many years operated by a
						former Deagan employee.&nbsp; Although its focus is on Deagan's smaller instruments (and similar
						instruments from other makers), some information about Deagan tower chimes may be available.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are isolated instances of other individuals or firms carrying out repairs or restorations
						of Deagan tubular chimes, but I know of no one else who is actively involved in such work
						now.&nbsp; There are at least two companies (Verdin and Chime Master) which have replaced Deagan
						actions and controls with their own, so that the only original items remaining are the tubular
						bells themselves and the frame in which they are hung.

					</span>

					<p>
						In 1925, the <b>McShane Bell Foundry Company</b>, a long-established maker of conventional tower
						bells, issued a pamphlet on "McShane Tubular Tower Chimes".&nbsp; McShane reported purchasing
						Durfee's tower chime business, and described how they were adding to it an electric chiming
						action with keyboard, using standard alternating current so that no special power supply
						equipment was needed.&nbsp; (Obviously, McShane must have been aware of the specifications for
						Deagan tower chimes, which required power supply equipment to produce direct current.&nbsp; But
						neither Deagan nor U.S. Tubular were mentioned by name in this pamphlet.)&nbsp; McShane offered
						sets of 15, 16 or 20 tones, all with the same starting note (A flat) and almost the same top
						note (D flat or E flat), with the 20-tone systems being fully chromatic.&nbsp; Any of these
						systems could also be supplied with a clock mechanism to chime the Westminster quarters and
						strike the hour.&nbsp; Unfortunately, no McShane tubular tower chimes are yet known to the
						compiler of these pages, so it is not yet certain that any were actually produced and sold.
