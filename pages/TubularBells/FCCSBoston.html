The first chime to be installed in the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Boston,
Massachusetts, was described in a contemporary newspaper article as follows:

<PRE>
[Boston Journal, January 7, 1895]

                   CHIMES RANG SWEETLY 

       Much admiration was expressed by all those fortunate  
       enough to listen to the first peal of the chimes in the tower 
       of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, corner of Fal-
       mouth and Norway Streets, dedicated yesterday. The  
       sweet, musical tones attracted quite a throng of people, 
       who listened with delight. 

       The chimes were made by the United States Tubular  
       Bell Company, of Methuen, Mass., and are something 
       of a novelty in this country, though for some time well
       and favorably known in the Old Country, especially in 
       England. 

       They are a substitution of tubes of drawn brass for the
       heavy cast bells of old-fashioned chimes. They have the 
       advantage of great economy of space, as well as of cost, a 
       chime of fifteen bells occupying a space not more than
       five by eight feet. 

       Where the old-fashioned chimes required a strong man 
       to ring them, these can be rung from an electric keyboard,
       and even when rung by hand require but little muscular 
       power to manipulate them and call forth all the purity 
       and sweetness of their tones. The quality of tone is some-
       thing superb, being rich and mellow. The tubes are care- 
       fully tuned, so that the harmony is perfect. They have 
       all the beauties of a great cathedral chime, with infinitely
       less expense. 

       There is practically no limit to the uses to which these 
       bells may be put. They can be called into requisition in
       theatres, concert halls, and public buildings, as they range 
       in all sizes, from those described down to little sets of 
       silver bells that might be placed on a small centre table.

Boston, 1895.]</PRE>
