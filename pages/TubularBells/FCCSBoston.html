                The first chime to be installed in the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Boston,
                Massachusetts, was described in a contemporary newspaper article as follows:

                <b>[Boston Journal, January 7, 1895]</b>
                <h2>CHIMES RANG SWEETLY</h2>
                <p>
                    Much admiration was expressed by all those fortunate enough to listen to the first 
                    peal of the chimes in the tower of The First Church of Christ, Scientist, corner of 
                    Falmouth and Norway Streets, dedicated yesterday. The sweet, musical tones attracted 
                    quite a throng of people, who listened with delight. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chimes were made by the United States Tubular Bell Company, of Methuen, Mass., and 
                    are something of a novelty in this country, though for some time well and favorably 
                    known in the Old Country, especially in England. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are a substitution of tubes of drawn brass for the heavy cast bells of old-fashioned 
                    chimes. They have the advantage of great economy of space, as well as of cost, a chime of 
                    fifteen bells occupying a space not more than five by eight feet. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where the old-fashioned chimes required a strong man to ring them, these can be rung from an 
                    electric keyboard, and even when rung by hand require but little muscular power to manipulate 
                    them and call forth all the purity and sweetness of their tones. The quality of tone is 
                    something superb, being rich and mellow. The tubes are carefully tuned, so that the harmony is 
                    perfect. They have all the beauties of a great cathedral chime, with infinitely less expense. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is practically no limit to the uses to which these bells may be put. They can be called into 
                    requisition in theatres, concert halls, and public buildings, as they range in all sizes, from those 
                    described down to little sets of silver bells that might be placed on a small centre table. 
                </p>
