			<h1>Rowland Hill Mayland  (1848-1916)</h1>
		</header>

		<section>
			<p>
				<b>Rowland H. Mayland</b> was the third and youngest child of silversmith George Mayland, who emigrated 
				from England to the USA about 1841, accompanied by his wife (Sarah) and their firstborn child.&nbsp;
				A daughter was born to them in Connecticut, but by the time Rowland was born, they had settled in Brooklyn, 
				New York, where they remained.&nbsp; (See <a href="#RES">Residences</a>, below.)&nbsp; George carried on the 
				silversmithing trade there until at least the mid-1880s, but his date of death and place of burial have not 
				yet been found.&nbsp; None of his children followed the silversmithing trade, at least not directly, and the 
				fate of the older two has not been discovered.&nbsp; (See <a href="#GEN">Genealogy</a>, below.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Rowland H. Mayland married young, and about that same time he went into business as a manufacturer of musical 
				instruments.&nbsp; (See <a href="#BUS">Business History</a>, below.)&nbsp; Business directories of the day 
				give no clue as to what types of musical instruments he made, but other evidence shows that there was quite a 
				variety.&nbsp; (See <a href="#REF">References</a>, below.)&nbsp; At some point, he became the first American 
				manufacturer of what are now called English handbells, and that may be reflected in the later business 
				directories which list his occupation as "musical bells".
			</p>
			<p>
				Rowland's wife, Julia, had the distinction of having been born at sea while en route to America.&nbsp;
				The only certainty about her family is the fact of their being English.&nbsp; However, it is possible that 
				they immigrated through Canada, because in the 1880 US census Julia gave her place of birth as Canada rather 
				than "At Sea."&nbsp; It is also possible that their family name was Stanley (see Mayland &amp; Stanley under 
				<a href="#BUS">Business History</a>, below); if that is correct, then the names of her parents and siblings 
				are also known.&nbsp; Rowland and Julia had two sons and a daughter, in the same order as his parents had 
				done.&nbsp; The older son became an engineer, and seems to have moved around quite a bit before settling in 
				California.&nbsp; The daughter lived at home, and did not marry until after her father's death.&nbsp; But she 
				must have been a great favorite of her parents, because she was always known by her nickname rather than her 
				given name until after she married.&nbsp; Only the younger son followed his father into the musical instrument 
				business.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to being an artisan and businessman, Rowland was a musician.&nbsp; As a youth during the Civil War, 
				he enlisted in the 56th New York Volunteers, where he served as drum major.&nbsp; (Many years later, this service 
				entitled his widow to a veteran's pension.)&nbsp; Possibly he continued service with this band after the war,
				because later he was described as having been its bandmaster.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a young man, he played the flute in several different minstrel groups in Brooklyn, and was sufficiently 
				well known to be able to contribute significantly to the writing of a book on minstrelsy many years afterward.&nbsp;
				In his middle years, he was sometimes a flute soloist at more genteel musical entertainments, accompanied by 
				his daughter at the piano.
			</p>
			<p>
				Rowland seems to have been of an inventive turn of mind, because he was issued
				four patents over the course of a decade, as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>
						No.531,323 (Dec.25, 1894) - Musical instrument <br />
						(composed of vibratory bars of wood, metal, etc., with resonators)
					</li>
					<li>
						No.663,085 (Dec.4, 1900) - Clock-chime <br/>
						(tubular bells with weighted top ends)
					</li>
					<li>
						No.770,437 (Sep.20, 1940) - Bell <br/>
						(tap bell with internal resonator chamber)
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				He was also the assignor of a patent issued to Robert J. Carson of New York City in 1903 (No.741,625, Oct.20) 
				for a "Strength-testing or punching machine," which was evidently intended to be coin operated, as in an 
				entertainment arcade.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>
				Rowland was also quite civic minded.&nbsp; He became well known as a volunteer fireman, and eventually was
				a key figure in the establishment of a firemen's home in Hudson, New York, and thereafter a trustee of it.&nbsp;
				After moving his family from Brooklyn to Freeport, Long Island, he became Vice President of the Freeport Board 
				of Education, and also served as President of the Board of Health.&nbsp; He was one of the organizers of the 
				Freeport Lodge of Elks.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1909, Rowland H. Mayland was one of three directors of the Eaton-Hough Company of New York City, a firm which 
				seems to have had some involvement with calculating machines.
			</p>
			<p>
				Rowland Mayland died at his home in Freeport, at the age of 68.&nbsp; The cause of his death and the place of 
				his burial have not been discovered.&nbsp; He was survived by his wife and all three of their children,
				and the results of his long-lasting business have survived to the present day.

					</ul>

					(Brooklyn city directories after 1913 are not available online.&nbsp; Those which are available rarely 
					include classified sections.)
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>Mayland & Stanley</b></p>

					<p>
						This partnership appeared in the city directories only once, in 1885.&nbsp; The name was in boldface 
						type, and the business description was "musical instrument makers."&nbsp; Its address was 227 Fulton, 
						which was (as noted above) a second business address for Rowland H. Mayland in that year.&nbsp;
						So he must have been one of the partners.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
						Brooklyn city directories, unlike those of many other cities, rarely included the names of principals 
						in partnership or corporate entries, and personal entries for such principals rarely included the name 
						of the partnership or company in which they were involved.&nbsp; That makes it difficult to trace the 
						management of such businesses.&nbsp; In this case, however, there is additional supporting evidence.
					</p>
					<p>
						From at least as early as 1878, Edwin J. Stanley had been working in the same business and at the same 
						address as Rowland H. Mayland.&nbsp; They even had the same residence address at least once.&nbsp;
						In 1885, Edwin's business address was that of the Mayland &amp; Stanley partnership, leading to the 
						obvious conclusion that he was the other partner in this venture.&nbsp; Furthermore, in subsequent years 
						he continued in the same business at the same address, even though Rowland H. Mayland was no longer involved 
						at that location.&nbsp; Eventually he moved his business to other addresses, but he continued in the same
						line of work until about 1896, after which he disappeared from the city directories.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is circumstantial evidence that Edwin J. Stanley was Rowland H. Mayland's brother-in-law.&nbsp;
						Edwin had a sister named Julia, who disappeared from U.S. census records about the time that Rowland acquired 
						a wife named Julia, of about the same age.&nbsp; Furthermore, Rowland and Julia named their second son Edwin 
						Stanley Mayland.&nbsp; (See <a href="#GEN">Genealogy</a>, above.)&nbsp; Also, Edwin and his brother Franklin 
						and his widowed mother Annie may have been living with the Maylands in 1880.&nbsp; For these reasons, Julia's 
						maiden name has been shown as Stanley in the <a href="#GEN">Genealogy</a>, above.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>American Bell & Chime Company</b></p>
					<p>
						This business name appears in the Brooklyn directories only in 1900 and 1902, both times at the same 
						address as Rowland H. Mayland (351 Adams).&nbsp; The first year, its business is "Automatic Slot 
						Machines;" the second year, it is simply "bells."&nbsp; But note that this is also about the time that 
						a patent for a coin-operated machine was assigned to Rowland (see above).&nbsp; This seems to indicate 
						that his business interests were somewhat diverse.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>R. H. Mayland's Son</b></p>
					<p>
						After the death of Rowland H. Mayland, if not before, the name of the firm was changed, and it was 
						advertised as such in trade journals.&nbsp; (See cut below).&nbsp; The name <b>R. H. Mayland & Son</b>, 
						which is occasionally seen in various writings of others, is probably a misinterpretation of the rather 
						unusual actual name.&nbsp; The firm remained at the Willoughby Street address in Brooklyn throughout the 
						lifetime of Edwin Stanley Mayland.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>Mayland Chimes</b></p>
					<p>
						At some point, the name of the firm was changed to this final form.&nbsp; It is well known that 
						Mayland supplied sets of tubular chimes to clockmakers for use in longcase ("grandfather") clocks with 
						Westminster quarter-chime actions.&nbsp; Mayland also supplied sets of rod chimes for similar use in shelf 
						or bracket clocks, and these are equally well known among clock enthusiasts.&nbsp; However, aside from the two 
						Mayland tower chimes which are listed in these pages, there seems to be no substantive evidence of Mayland's 
						work in this field.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, much remains to be discovered.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The Meneely/Troy bellfoundry supplied a 159-pound bell to R.H.Mayland's Son of Brooklyn NY on Apr.13, 
				1905.&nbsp; Presumably this would have been a factory bell.&nbsp; It is not known whether the year is 
				a typo or whether this is evidence that Mayland, now nearly sixty years of age, had effectively turned 
				the business over to his son.&nbsp; However, up to 1913 this business name did not appear in the Brooklyn 
				city directories.&nbsp;
			</p>
			<p>
				The business was relocated to Lakeside, Connecticut, in the late 1960s by Edwin Stanley Mayland, Jr.&nbsp;
				It has been reported that in 1977 the business was sold to the Verdin Company of Cincinnati; but whether that 
				is correct, and what happened thereafter, are unclear, because other evidence indicates that at least part of 
				the business continued until the  death of Edwin Stanley Mayland, Jr.&nbsp; Nowadays, both Mayland and Deagan 
				organ chimes are being sold by Organ Supply Company of Erie, PA, and OSC's literature indicates that they have 
				been doing so since 1993.

			<p>
				In view of what's known about the one surviving Mayland tower chime recorded here, <br/>
				it is quite possible that the catalogue might have included both indoor and tower chimes.
