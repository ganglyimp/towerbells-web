			<h1>Tubular Bell Patents</h1>
			<p>
				Here you will find a list of American patents related to tubular bells.&nbsp; This is supporting detail 
				for the parent page about <A HREF="TubularBells.html">Tubular Tower Bells</A>.&nbsp; If you haven't read 
				that page yet, you should, because it presents some of the historical and cultural context in which these 
				patents were developed, and identifies the uses to which some of them were put.&nbsp; Although few of these 
				patents are specifically related to the use of tubular bells in tower chimes, all have some relevance to the 
				development of tubular bells.
			</p>
		</header>

		<section>
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
				John Harrington, of Coventry, Warwick county, England, patented a clock-chime of tubular bells in that country 
				in 1884.&nbsp; Soon afterwards, his tubular bells were being used in England in both hall clocks and bell 
				towers.&nbsp; (Different sized tubes were used for these different applications, of course.)&nbsp;
				Harrington's early European patents are cited in the first paragraph of the text of the first two American patents 
				listed below.
			</p>
			<p>
				Walter H. Durfee, working in Providence, Rhode Island, USA, began importing English clock movements and 
				Harrington's tubular bells to the USA about 1886.&nbsp; The earliest American patents were obtained by either 
				Durfee or one of the Harringtons, as detailed below, and at first formed the basis for a monopoly on longcase 
				chiming clocks, jointly held by Durfee and Harrington.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later patents obtained by other inventors often cite the unsatisfactory performance of prior art.&nbsp;  
				As such, their claims refer not to entirely new inventions but to significant technical improvements which 
				are claimed to remedy various defects in the original or preceding inventions.
			</p>

			<h2>American Patents</h2>
			<p>
				All of the patents issued by the United States Patent Office are accessible online.&nbsp; Follow the 
				instructions in the next paragraph to see them while you continue to read this page.
			</p>
			<p>
				The U.S.Patent Office Website includes both drawings and text of every patent issued.&nbsp; Unfortunately, 
				it is not possible to link directly to specific patent records of the Patent Office.&nbsp; Instead, you must 
				take these steps:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Click <A HREF="http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm" TARGET="PATENTSEARCH">this link</A>
					to open a search window for the Patent Office database, independent of the window you are reading.&nbsp;
					(You may wish to re-size that window so that you can still read these instructions.&nbsp; And if your 
					browser is configured to open a URL such as this in a new tab instead of a new window, you'll have to do 
					that on your own.)
				</li>
				<li>
					In the Query box at the left of that page, enter a patent number from the list below; then click the 
					Search button near the center of the page.&nbsp; (You may include or omit the commas in patent numbers.) <br/>
					<SMALL>
						NOTE: If instead you see a short page which says "Maximum number of users has been reached," then you must 
						wait a while and try again later.
					</SMALL>
				</li>
				<li>
					A results page will state that "Full text is not available for this patent.&nbsp; Click on 'Images' button 
					above to view full patent."&nbsp; Do that.
				</li>
				<li>
					You should now see the first page of the patent as published.&nbsp; To see the next page, click the gold 
					right-arrow button in the left column of the page; to back up, use the Back button on your browser.
				</li>
				<li>
					To view another patent, return to the patent search page again.&nbsp; To do that, you can either use the 
					Back button on that browser window or click the link above in this window (which will reset that window).
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				All American patents are classified under a system which is intended to group related inventions.&nbsp;
				Every patent has a primary classification; some also have one or more secondary classifications.&nbsp;
				The classifications relevant to our subject are as follows:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>84/103</b> = music / bells
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>116/169</b> = signals and indicators / tube or rod type
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<p>
				The following list of American patents states the patent number, the year in which the patent was awarded 
				(which may not be the same as the year in which the application was filed), and the patent classification(s).  
			</p>
			<p>
				For each patent, "Who" names the inventor to whom the patent was awarded.&nbsp; In some cases, the inventor is 
				identified as "assignor to" another person or a business, so that the latter had actual control and use of the 
				patent.
			</p>
			<p>
				For each patent, "What" shows the title of the patent, followed by a very brief summary of its claim(s).

						of Methuen, Massachusetts
					</DD>
					<DD>
						<B>What:</B> Tubular Bell - a tubular bell which was reinforced by an annular ring inside and/or 
						outside of the top edge, which was the point of strike for the hammer; cites the unsatisfactory 
						performance of prior art, especially the diametric pin; this clearly refers to one of the possibilities 
						covered by Harrington's 1892 patent.

						place"
					</DD>
					<DD>
						<B>What:</B> Tubular Bell for Chiming Clocks - specifying that the top end of the tube be nearly 
						closed by a spun shape, with a small hole in the center, and with no stiffening devices anywhere.&nbsp;
						(Several alternate shapes, including hemispherical, were specified.)
					</DD>
				<DT><B>#685,045</B> - 1901 - 116/169</DT>
					<DD>
						<B>Who:</B> Charles A. Jacques, of New York City, assignor to "Bawo &amp; Dotter, New York, N.Y., a

						bells
					</DD>
				<DT><B>#686,301</B> - 1901 - 116/169</DT>
					<DD><B>Who:</B> Jacques, assignor to Bawo & Dotter</DD>
					<DD>
						<B>What:</B> Tubular Bell - various types of improvements on prior art, including a solid cap closing 
						the top of the tube, a transverse tube enclosing the supporting cable, and tuning by means of cutting 
						away part of the tube or perforating or notching it
					</DD>
				<DT><B>#718,388</B> - 1903 - 116/169</DT>
					<DD>
						<B>Who:</B> Albert Schoenhut, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (without initial report of assignment)
					</DD>
					<DD>
						<B>What:</B> Musical Instrument - a tubular bell in which strengthening near the suspension and 
						striking points was accomplished by forming annular grooves of various shape.  (These grooves appear 
						on the interior of the tube as annular ridges.)  Schoenhut specifically anticipated use in chiming-clocks, 
						though his diagram shows striking with a hammer and the text recognizes "other uses that may readily 
						suggest themselves."
					</DD>
				<DT><B>#760,070</B> - 1904 - 116/169</DT>
					<DD><B>Who:</B> Jacques, assignor to Bawo & Dotter</DD>
					<DD><B>What:</B> Chiming-clock - an improvement to chiming clock bell frames</DD>
				<DT><B>#864,461</B> - 1907 - 116/169, 84/402, 446/421</DT>
					<DD><B>Who:</B> Henry Gibbs, of Austin, Illinois</DD>
					<DD>
						<B>What:</B> Chime - what is now called a "wind chime", though Gibbs envisioned it as being rung 
						manually as a summons (e.g., to dinner).

					<DD><B>Who:</B> Rowland H. Mayland (without initial report of assignment)</DD>
					<DD>
						<B>What:</B> Tubular Bell - yet another variation in reinforcement of the tube top.&nbsp; One of the 
						witnesses to the Specification of the patent, Edwin S. Mayland, was the son of Rowland H. Mayland.&nbsp;
						This design was used by Mayland for the tubular bells of the tower chime that he built about this time 
						for the new <a href="data/NYFRHLCG.HTM">Church-in-the-Gardens</a>, Forest Hills, NY.
