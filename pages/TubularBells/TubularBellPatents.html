			<h1>Tubular Bell Patents</h1>
			<p>
				Here you will find a list of American patents related to tubular bells.&nbsp; This is supporting detail
				for the parent page about <a href="/towerbells-web/pages/TubularBells/TubularBells.html">Tubular Tower Bells</a>.&nbsp;
				If you haven't read that page yet, you should, because it presents some of the historical and cultural
				context in which these patents were developed, and identifies the uses to which some of them were
				put.&nbsp; Although few of these patents are specifically related to the use of tubular bells in tower
				chimes, all have some relevance to the development of tubular bells.
			</p>
		</header>

		<section>
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
				John Harrington, of Coventry, Warwick county, England, patented a clock-chime of tubular bells in that
				country in 1884.&nbsp; Soon afterwards, his tubular bells were being used in England in both hall clocks
				and bell towers.&nbsp; (Different sized tubes were used for these different applications, of
				course.)&nbsp; Harrington's early European patents are cited in the first paragraph of the text of the
				first two American patents listed below.
			</p>
			<p>
				Walter H. Durfee, working in Providence, Rhode Island, USA, began importing English clock movements and
				Harrington's tubular bells to the USA about 1886.&nbsp; The earliest American patents were obtained by
				either Durfee or one of the Harringtons, as detailed below, and at first formed the basis for a monopoly
				on longcase chiming clocks, jointly held by Durfee and Harrington.
			</p>
			<p>
				Later patents obtained by other inventors often cite the unsatisfactory performance of prior art.&nbsp;
				As such, their claims refer not to entirely new inventions but to significant technical improvements
				which are claimed to remedy various defects in the original or preceding inventions.
			</p>
		</section>

			<h2>American Patents</h2>
			<p>
				All of the patents issued by the United States Patent Office are accessible online.&nbsp; Follow the
				instructions in the next paragraph to see them while you continue to read this page.
			</p>
			<p>
				The U.S.Patent Office Website includes both drawings and text of every patent issued.&nbsp;
				Unfortunately, it is not possible to link directly to specific patent records of the Patent
				Office.&nbsp; Instead, you must take these steps:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Click <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm" target="PATENTSEARCH">this link</a>
					to open a search window for the Patent Office database, independent of the window you are
					reading.&nbsp; (You may wish to re-size that window so that you can still read these
					instructions.&nbsp; And if your browser is configured to open a URL such as this in a new tab
					instead of a new window, you'll have to do that on your own.)
				</li>
				<li>
					In the Query box at the left of that page, enter a patent number from the list below; then click the
					Search button near the center of the page.&nbsp; (You may include or omit the commas in patent
					numbers.) <br />

					<small>
						NOTE: If instead you see a short page which says "Maximum number of users has been reached,"
						then you must wait a while and try again later.
					</small>
				</li>
				<li>
					A results page will state that "Full text is not available for this patent.&nbsp; Click on 'Images'
					button above to view full patent."&nbsp; Do that.
				</li>
				<li>
					You should now see the first page of the patent as published.&nbsp; To see the next page, click the
					gold right-arrow button in the left column of the page; to back up, use the Back button on your
					browser.
				</li>
				<li>
					To view another patent, return to the patent search page again.&nbsp; To do that, you can either use
					the Back button on that browser window or click the link above in this window (which will reset that
					window).
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				All American patents are classified under a system which is intended to group related inventions.&nbsp;
				Every patent has a primary classification; some also have one or more secondary classifications.&nbsp;
				The classifications relevant to our subject are as follows:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>84/103</b> = music / bells
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>116/169</b> = signals and indicators / tube or rod type
				</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<p>
				The following list of American patents states the patent number, the year in which the patent was
				awarded (which may not be the same as the year in which the application was filed), and the patent
				classification(s).
			</p>
			<p>
				For each patent, "Who" names the inventor to whom the patent was awarded.&nbsp; In some cases, the
				inventor is identified as "assignor to" another person or a business, so that the latter had actual
				control and use of the patent.
			</p>
			<p>
				For each patent, "What" shows the title of the patent, followed by a very brief summary of its claim(s).

					<b>Who:</b> James E. Treat, of Boston, Massachusetts, assignor to United States Tubular Bell
					Company, of Methuen, Massachusetts
				</dd>
				<dd>
					<b>What:</b> Tubular Bell - a tubular bell which was reinforced by an annular ring inside and/or
					outside of the top edge, which was the point of strike for the hammer; cites the unsatisfactory
					performance of prior art, especially the diametric pin; this clearly refers to one of the
					possibilities covered by Harrington's 1892 patent.
				</dd>
				<dt><b>#656,603</b> - 1900 - 116/169, 84/403</dt>

					city
				</dd>
				<dd>
					<b>What:</b> Tubular Bell for Chiming Clocks - cites unsatisfactory prior art in the form of tubes
					with end plates, diametric pins, or plugs.&nbsp; The patent claim is based on the addition of
					diaphragms at both ends of the tube, with a small axial perforation in the one at the top and a
					larger axial perforation in the one at the bottom.
				</dd>

				<dd>
					<b>What:</b> Tubular Bell for Chiming Clocks - specifying that the top end of the tube be nearly
					closed by a spun shape, with a small hole in the center, and with no stiffening devices
					anywhere.&nbsp; (Several alternate shapes, including hemispherical, were specified.)
				</dd>
				<dt><b>#685,045</b> - 1901 - 116/169</dt>
				<dd>
					<b>Who:</b> Charles A. Jacques, of New York City, assignor to "Bawo &amp; Dotter, New York, N.Y., a

					bells
				</dd>
				<dt><b>#686,301</b> - 1901 - 116/169</dt>
				<dd><b>Who:</b> Jacques, assignor to Bawo & Dotter</dd>
				<dd>
					<b>What:</b> Tubular Bell - various types of improvements on prior art, including a solid cap
					closing the top of the tube, a transverse tube enclosing the supporting cable, and tuning by means
					of cutting away part of the tube or perforating or notching it
				</dd>
				<dt><b>#718,388</b> - 1903 - 116/169</dt>
				<dd>
					<b>Who:</b> Albert Schoenhut, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (without initial report of assignment)
				</dd>
				<dd>
					<b>What:</b> Musical Instrument - a tubular bell in which strengthening near the suspension and
					striking points was accomplished by forming annular grooves of various shape. (These grooves appear
					on the interior of the tube as annular ridges.) Schoenhut specifically anticipated use in
					chiming-clocks,
					though his diagram shows striking with a hammer and the text recognizes "other uses that may readily
					suggest themselves."
				</dd>
				<dt><b>#760,070</b> - 1904 - 116/169</dt>
				<dd><b>Who:</b> Jacques, assignor to Bawo & Dotter</dd>
				<dd><b>What:</b> Chiming-clock - an improvement to chiming clock bell frames</dd>
				<dt><b>#864,461</b> - 1907 - 116/169, 84/402, 446/421</dt>
				<dd><b>Who:</b> Henry Gibbs, of Austin, Illinois</dd>
				<dd>
					<b>What:</b> Chime - what is now called a "wind chime", though Gibbs envisioned it as being rung
					manually as a summons (e.g., to dinner).
				</dd>
				<dt><b>#1,057,003</b> - 1913 (application dated 1910) - 116/169</dt>
				<dd><b>Who:</b> Rowland H. Mayland (without initial report of assignment)</dd>
				<dd>
					<b>What:</b> Tubular Bell - yet another variation in reinforcement of the tube top.&nbsp; One of the
					witnesses to the Specification of the patent, Edwin S. Mayland, was the son of Rowland H.
					Mayland.&nbsp; This design was used by Mayland for the tubular bells of the tower chime that he
					built about this time for the new <a href="/towerbells-web/data/NYFRHLCG.HTM">Church-in-the-Gardens</a>, Forest
					Hills, NY.
