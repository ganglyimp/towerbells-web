Here you will find a list of American patents related to tubular bells.&nbsp;
This is supporting detail for the parent page about 
<A HREF="TubularBells.html">Tubular Tower Bells</A>.&nbsp;
If you haven't read that page yet, you should, because it presents some of
the historical and cultural context in which these patents were developed,
and identifies the uses to which some of them were put.&nbsp;
Although few of these patents are specifically related to the use of tubular bells
in tower chimes, all have some relevance to the development of tubular bells.
<P>
<hr>
<p>
<H3>Background:</H3>
John Harrington, of Coventry, Warwick county, England, 
patented a clock-chime of tubular bells in that country in 1884.&nbsp;
Soon afterwards, his tubular bells were being used in England in both hall clocks and bell towers.&nbsp;
(Different sized tubes were used for these different applications, of course.)&nbsp;
Harrington's early European patents are cited in the first paragraph of the text of the
first two American patents listed below.
<p>
Walter H. Durfee, working in Providence, Rhode Island, USA, 
began importing English clock movements and Harrington's tubular bells to the USA about 1886.&nbsp;
The earliest American patents were obtained by either Durfee or one of the Harringtons,
as detailed below, and at first formed the basis for a monopoly on longcase chiming clocks,
jointly held by Durfee and Harrington.
<p>
Later patents obtained by other inventors often cite the unsatisfactory performance of prior art.&nbsp;  
As such, their claims refer not to entirely new inventions 
but to significant technical improvements which are claimed to remedy 
various defects in the original or preceding inventions.

All of the patents issued by the United States Patent Office are accessible online.&nbsp;
Follow the instructions in the next paragraph to see them while you continue to read this page.
<p>
The U.S.Patent Office Website includes both drawings and text of every patent issued.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, it is not possible to link directly to specific patent records of the Patent Office.&nbsp;
Instead, you must take these steps:
<OL>
	<LI>Click <A HREF="http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm" TARGET="PATENTSEARCH">this link</A>
		to open a search window for the Patent Office database, 
		independent of the window you are reading.&nbsp;
		(You may wish to re-size that window so that you can still read these instructions.&nbsp;
		And if your browser is configured to open a URL such as this in a new tab 
		instead of a new window, you'll have to do that on your own.)
	<LI>In the Query box at the left of that page, enter a patent number from the list below;
		then click the Search button near the center of the page.&nbsp;
		(You may include or omit the commas in patent numbers.)&nbsp;
		<BR><SMALL>NOTE: If instead you see a short page which says
		"Maximum number of users has been reached," then you must wait a while
		and try again later.</SMALL>
	<LI>A results page will state that "Full text is not available for this patent.&nbsp;
		Click on 'Images' button above to view full patent."&nbsp;
		Do that.
	<LI>You should now see the first page of the patent as published.&nbsp;
		To see the next page, click the gold right-arrow button in the left column of the page; 
		to back up, use the Back button on your browser.
	<LI>To view another patent, return to the patent search page again.&nbsp;

<p>
All American patents are classified under a system which is intended to group related inventions.&nbsp;
Every patent has a primary classification; some also have one or more secondary classifications.&nbsp;
The classifications relevant to our subject are as follows:
<UL>
	<LI><B>84/103</B> = music / bells
	<LI><B>116/169</B> = signals and indicators / tube or rod type
	</UL>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The following list of American patents states the patent number, the year in which the patent
was awarded (which may not be the same as the year in which the application was filed),
and the patent classification(s).  
<br>For each patent, "Who" names the inventor to whom the patent was awarded.&nbsp;
In some cases, the inventor is identified as "assignor to" another person or a business, 
so that the latter had actual control and use of the patent.
<br>For each patent, "What" shows the title of the patent, 
followed by a very brief summary of its claim(s).

			cites the unsatisfactory performance of prior art, especially the diametric pin; 
			this clearly refers to one of the possibilities covered by Harrington's 1892 patent.
	<DT><B>#656,603</B> - 1900 - 116/169, 84/403</DT>
		<DD><B>Who:</B> Allen W. Harrington, of New York, NY,
			assignor to Harris &amp; Harrington, of the same city
		<DD><B>What:</B> Tubular Bell for Chiming Clocks - cites unsatisfactory prior art 
			in the form of tubes with end plates, diametric pins, or plugs.&nbsp;
			The patent claim is based on the addition of diaphragms at both ends of the tube, 
			with a small axial perforation in the one at the top 
			and a larger axial perforation in the one at the bottom.
	<DT><B>#663,085</B> - 1900 - 116/169, 84/406</DT>

			be nearly closed by a spun shape, with a small hole in the center, 
			and with no stiffening devices anywhere.&nbsp;
			(Several alternate shapes, including hemispherical, were specified.)
	<DT><B>#685,045</B> - 1901 - 116/169</DT>
		<DD><B>Who:</B> Charles A. Jacques, of New York City, assignor to 
			"Bawo &amp; Dotter, New York, N.Y., a corporation of New Jersey."

		<DD><B>Who:</B> Jacques, assignor to Bawo &amp; Dotter
		<DD><B>What:</B> Tubular Bell - various types of improvements on prior art, including 
			a solid cap closing the top of the tube, a transverse tube enclosing the supporting cable, 
			and tuning by means of cutting away part of the tube or perforating or notching it
	<DT><B>#718,388</B> - 1903 - 116/169</DT>
		<DD><B>Who:</B> Albert Schoenhut, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 
			(without initial report of assignment)
		<DD><B>What:</B> Musical Instrument - a tubular bell in which strengthening 
			near the suspension and striking points was accomplished by forming 
			annular grooves of various shape.  (These grooves appear on the interior of the tube 
			as annular ridges.)  Schoenhut specifically anticipated use in chiming-clocks, 
			though his diagram shows striking with a hammer and the text recognizes 
			"other uses that may readily suggest themselves."
	<DT><B>#760,070</B> - 1904 - 116/169</DT>
		<DD><B>Who:</B> Jacques, assignor to Bawo &amp; Dotter
		<DD><B>What:</B> Chiming-clock - an improvement to chiming clock bell frames
	<DT><B>#864,461</B> - 1907 - 116/169, 84/402, 446/421</DT>
		<DD><B>Who:</B> Henry Gibbs, of Austin, Illinois
		<DD><B>What:</B> Chime - what is now called a "wind chime", though Gibbs envisioned it as
			being rung manually as a summons (e.g., to dinner).
	<DT><B>#1,057,003</B> - 1913 (application dated 1910) - 116/169</DT>
		<DD><B>Who:</B> Rowland H. Mayland (without initial report of assignment)
		<DD><B>What:</B> Tubular Bell - yet another variation in reinforcement of the tube top.&nbsp;
			One of the witnesses to the Specification of the patent, Edwin S. Mayland,
			was the son of Rowland H. Mayland.&nbsp;
			This design was used by Mayland for the tubular bells of the tower chime 
			that he built about this time for the new
			<a href="data/NYFRHLCG.HTM">Church-in-the-Gardens</a>, Forest Hills, NY.
<P>
Other patents were later issued for a variety of other improvements to clock chime mechanisms; 
all were assigned to various clock making companies.

			horizontal electric striker and a vertical electric damper above the top of a 
			vertically-hung sound-producing cylindrical bar
	<DT><B>#2,400,125</B> - 1943 - 116/169, 340/392.4</DT>
		<DD><B>Who:</B> Louis A. Maas, of Glendale, California
		<DD><B>What:</B> Balanced Suspension for Chimes - used electric strikers and dampers;
			but the details of the drawings seem to indicate that this mechanism was more 
			suited for use in organs than in towers.
