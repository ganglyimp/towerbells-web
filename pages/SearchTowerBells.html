            <p>
              The TowerBells Website has been structured and indexed to be as useful as possible without searching.&nbsp;
              However, we realize that some visitors prefer to use a search tool, and that others may be seeking 
              information that isn't readily located using our structure and indexes.&nbsp; To meet these needs, we 
              provide a customized search facility based on the well-known Google search engine.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can search the TowerBells Website for any word or phrase. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <B>Tip:</B> &nbsp; To search for a phrase, such as a multi-word name, enclose it in quote marks, thus: "Christ Church".
            </p>

                <b>NOTE:</b>&nbsp; 
                The Google search results page will not list any pages that we have added since the last time that 
                Google crawled this Website.&nbsp; (No one knows when that was, and Google isn't telling!)&nbsp;
                Also, the results page might not reflect changes we have made during the same period, 
                if the changes added the word(s) for which you are searching.
            </p>
            <p>
                To find those newly-added or changed pages, you might look at our <A HREF="WhatsNew/WhatIsNew.html">What's New</A> 
                page, which reports our view of non-trivial changes to the Website.
