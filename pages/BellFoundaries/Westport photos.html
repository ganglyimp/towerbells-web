The two cast-iron support posts are			bolted to the ends of a single foot timber which is fastened to the floor, and are held in			position by brace rods which angle down to the left.  There is no wheel; instead a lever is			bolted vertically to the yoke, just off center.  			(This tends to corroborate the church's tradition that the bell came from a steamboat.)			The bell rope is sloppily tied to the end of the lever, with the excess rope lying on the 			floor in the foreground.  The rope runs through a large pulley block near the floor at left,			and thence down to the ground floor of the tower.  A long coil spring is also attached to			the end of the lever, possibly to counter the weight of the bell rope.			<p>			The red paint on the bell is ancient, and has faded or weathered away unevenly.  			Curiously, the fittings, which are much more susceptible to corrosion than the bell			have never been painted.  The white spots on the bell (and elsewhere) are splatters of paint 			from sloppy work on the belfry in the past.			</TD>		</TR>	<TR>		<TD>The yoke, here seen in profile, is tapered and recurved; the ends of the yoke form the			gudgeons (bearing pins) and rest in open slots (with closed ends) in the tops of the			support posts.  The bell is supported by a single center bolt which passes through the			body of the yoke; a support flange below the center of the yoke meets the flat top of			the bell.			</TD>		<TD><IMG SRC="graphics/Caughlan%20Westport%20005.JPG" ALT="Westport photo 005" WIDTH=422 HEIGHT=282></TD>		</TR>	<TR>		<TD><IMG SRC="graphics/Caughlan%20Westport%20006.JPG" ALT="Westport photo 006" WIDTH=282 HEIGHT=422></TD>		<TD>As above, showing all of the bell but less of the yoke.  			<p>There is very little decoration			on the bell - a shallow bead (barely seen in profile) on the top of the shoulder,			a very heavy bead at the edge of the shoulder, a small bead below the waist (where the			concave profile of the waist meets the convex profile of the soundbow), and a small step			at the top of the straight lip.			<p>What here appears to be a shoulder band, more prominent on the left side than the right,			is just the bottom edge of the inscription (which is shown in more detail below).			</TD>		</TR>	<TR>		<TD><IMG SRC="graphics/Caughlan%20Westport%20007.JPG" ALT="Westport photo 007" WIDTH=282 HEIGHT=422></TD>		<TD>The cast iron support posts are very fancy.  Instead of having an obvious straight post, 			they are formed with a long S-shaped curve, thickest in the middle, with the ends 			curled into circles around solid five-pointed stars.  The bearing block is on top, and			a foot plate (here invisible under the roofing material which floors the belfry) is on			the bottom.  The dangling excess rope and the brace rod behind the support post largely			obscure the fact that there is additional ironwork between the upper circle and the			middle of the S-curve to carry the vertical load.			</TD>		</TR>	<TR>		<TD>The maker's inscription consists of three sections of lettering, side by side.			In each section, there is one word in a straight line at the bottom,			one or two words arched over the top, and either a space or a few characters in the middle.			<P>Here the center and right sections are visible, but most of the left section is obscured			by the yoke.			<P>The following three photos show the sections more clearly, in order.			</TD>		<TD><IMG SRC="graphics/Caughlan%20Westport%20020.JPG" ALT="Westport photo 020" WIDTH=422 HEIGHT=282></TD>		</TR>	<TR>		<TD>This photo shows the first (leftmost) section of the maker's inscription:			<P ALIGN=CENTER>CAST BY			<P ALIGN=CENTER>CAUGHLAN			<P ALIGN=LEFT>There is an ampersand (&amp;) after "Caughlan", almost hidden in the shadow of			the yoke (see next photo).			</TD>		<TD><IMG SRC="graphics/Caughlan%20Westport%20011.JPG" ALT="Westport photo 011" WIDTH=422 HEIGHT=282></TD>		</TR>	<TR>		<TD>The center section of the maker's inscription:			<P ALIGN=CENTER>S<SMALL><SUP>T</SUP>..</SMALL> LOUIS			<BR>M<SMALL><SUP>O</SUP>..</SMALL>			<BR>PIQUETT			<P ALIGN=LEFT>The T of the abbreviation for Saint is a small capital letter			raised above a pair of periods (..).			Similarly the O of the abbreviation for Missouri is a small capital letter 			standing on a dash (-) above a pair of periods (..).			</TD>		<TD><IMG SRC="graphics/Caughlan%20Westport%20010.JPG" ALT="Westport photo 010" WIDTH=422 HEIGHT=282></TD>		</TR>	<TR>		<TD>The rightmost section of the maker's inscription:			<P ALIGN=CENTER>BELL &amp; BRASS			<BR>1853			<BR>FOUNDRY</P>			<P ALIGN=LEFT>At the very top of the photo can be seen the cracked remains of a thin			wooden pad between the top of the bell and the flange of the yoke.
