vicinity, Massachusetts</h3><p>Although there were small-scale bellfounders working in America at least as early as 1717,the first significant bellfoundry was that of Col.Aaron Hobart, which operated in Abingdonfor thirty years beginning in 1861.<p>The first major post-Revolutionary bellfoundry was established in 1792 in Boston by the famous patriot Paul Revere.&nbsp;For further information about it, see the <A HREF="RevereFoundry.html">Revere foundry</A> page here.<p>Various apprentices of Paul Revere were later involved in the establishment of at least two regionally important bell foundries.&nbsp;One was set up by George Holbrook in the nearby town of Medway; for further information, see the <A HREF="HolbrookFoundry.html">Holbrook foundry page</A> here.<p>Another, begun by Henry Hooper, was one of the four minor American makers of chimes.&nbsp;The data side of this Website has an <A HREF="data/IXfoundryHooperBlake.html">index of Hooper/Blake chimes</A>,with an outline of the history of that foundry.<p><h3>Saint Louis, Missouri</h3><p>At least 37 different business enterprises are known to have made, sold or advertisedbells in the city of St.Louis at various times during the last two-thirds of the 19th century, with a few of them lasting into the first half of the 20th century.&nbsp;One of them was large enough to compete successfully with the major bellfoundries to the east,and was among the four minor American makers of chimes.&nbsp;The data side of this Website has an <A HREF="data/IXfoundryStuckstede.html">index of Stuckstede chimes</A>,with an outline of the history of the two Stuckstede foundries.<p>For further information, see the <A HREF="StLouisBellFoundries.html">Saint Louis Bell Foundries</A> page here.<p><h3>New York, New York</h3><p>As the largest metropolitan area in the country, and one of the oldest, this was the home of a large number of different bellfoundries in the 18th and 19th centuries, though none of them lasted very long nor produced many bells.<p><h3>Troy and West Troy (Watervliet), New York</h3><p>These towns were the homes of two of the largest bellfoundries in America,operated by competing branches of the Meneely family.&nbsp;Both of those foundries were among the three major American makers of chimes.&nbsp;Another bellfoundry in Troy was among the four minor American makers of chimes.&nbsp;A few other bellfoundries were also located here from time to time.&nbsp;West Troy, originally named Gibbonsville, later was renamed Watervliet.&nbsp;The data side of this Website has indexes of <A HREF="data/IXfoundryJones.html">chimes by Jones</A> (Troy),<A HREF="data/IXfoundryMeneelyWvlt.html">carillons and chimes by Meneely (Watervliet)</A> and <A HREF="data/IXfoundryMeneelyTroy.html">chimes by Meneely (Troy)</A>;each of those three pages includes a sketch of that foundry's history plus links to further information.<p><h3>Southwestern Ohio</h3><p>Several bellfoundries in Cincinnati, including two of the largest and longest-lived in the USA,made either bronze or iron bells.&nbsp;One of those, the Buckeye Bell Foundry (operated by Vanduzen), was among the four minor American makers of chimes;the data side of this Website has an <A HREF="data/IXfoundryVanduzen.html">index of Vanduzen chimes</A>,including a brief sketch of the history of this foundry.<p>The largest of many American producers of iron or steel bells was probably the <A HREF="HillsboroFoundry.html">C.S.Bell Company</A>, located in the town of Hillsboro, east of Cincinnati.&nbsp;Using a special cast steel alloy called "crystal metal," this firm produced bells of all sizes from 12" diameter postmount farm or dinner bells to 48" diameter church bells.&nbsp;These bells, unlike those made of bronze, do not carry any inscription (except for a size number on the top).&nbsp;Instead, the identification of the maker is found on the yoke from which the bell hangs.<p>Two of the three modern bellfoundries in the USA are located in this area:<UL>	<LI><A HREF="http://www.mwbells.com/">Meeks, Watson &amp; Company</A>		is located in Georgetown, southeast of Cincinnati.&nbsp;		The data side of this Website has an index of this foundry's 		<A HREF="data/IXfoundryMeeksWatson.html">carillons and chimes</A>;		that includes contact information as well as a history of the company.	<LI><A HREF="http://www.verdin.com/">The Verdin Company</A> of Cincinnati, 		for nearly a century a major producer of tower clocks 		(and still the foremost such company in the USA)		has a mobile foundry capable of casting single bells weighing up to 1000 pounds.&nbsp;		Constructed to carry out a contract for casting a bell in each of the 88 counties of Ohio,		during that state's year-long bicentennial celebration, 		this unique equipment is still available for use,		though you won't find mention of that on the company's extensive Website.&nbsp;		But you can find bits of information about it scattered throughout Verdin's 		<A HREF="http://www.verdin.com/bicentennial_news.html">compilation 		of Bicentennial news articles</A>.&nbsp;		It should be noted that although members of the Verdin family 		have been involved in the manufacture of tower clocks 		(formerly known as town clocks) for seven generations,		the Verdin Company as it exists today dates from the formation of		the I.T.Verdin Machine Company in 1927/8.&nbsp;	</UL><p><h3>Virginia</h3><p>Although it was never a a major center of bellfounding, this state is now home to the third and newest modern bellfoundry in the USA, that of <A HREF="http://www.sunderlinfoundry.com/">B.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Sunderlin</A>.&nbsp;The data side of this Website has an index of this foundry's work on<A HREF="data/IXfoundrySunderlin.html">carillons and chimes</A>.<p><h2>Bellfounders elsewhere</h2><p>Little is known of the foundries that made bells in Mexico, Central and South America,or the Orient, though it is clear that some bells were cast in these places as wellas being exported to them from Europe.&nbsp;Although a few of them cast great bells, and thus are mentioned in foundry indexes,none of them are known to have made bells for carillons or chimes.<p><hr><p><A HREF="TowerBells.html">[Tower Bells Introduction]</A><A HREF="WebsiteMap.html">[Website Map]</A><A HREF="CSZ.html">[The builder]</A><A HREF="WhatIsNew.html">[What's New]</A><p>This page was created 2002/09/02 and last revised 2020/12/12.<p>Please send comments or questions to<A HREF="mailto:csz_stl@swbell.net?subject=Comments%20on%20TowerBells%20BellFoundries">csz_stl@swbell.net</A><p><a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer"><img	src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-html40"	alt="Valid HTML 4.0 Transitional" height="31" width="88"></a>	<!-- Icon changed after revalidation on 2019/12/19 --></div></BODY></HTML>
