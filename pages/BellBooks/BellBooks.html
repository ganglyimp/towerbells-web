			<h1>Books about Tower Bells</h1>
			
			<p>
				In spite of the usefulness of the World Wide Web, printed books retain their
				importance as handy repositories of well-organized information, in a format 
				that is easier on the eyes than an illuminated computer screen.&nbsp; Here we 
				present a selective bibliography of books that are related to tower bells,
				either in their entirety or in a significant part.&nbsp; Each entry is accompanied 
				by either a brief description or a full review.&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				Within each section, entries are presented in reverse chronological order of publication.

				<book-review bookTitle="Bells of Falmouth - Stories from a historic Massachusetts town, uncovered by curiosity about bells"
							 author="Ken Peal"
							 publisherInfo="EBookBakery Books, 2023"
							 isbn="978-1-953080-43-1"
							 materialInfo='9" x 6", paperback, viii+96pp, illus.'

					<div slot="review-text">
						<p>
							Ken's interesting book not only provides a catalog of an important category of surviving historical artifacts, 
							but also presents the social and economic contexts that led to the original acquisition, usage and (in most cases) 
							eventual survival of each one.&nbsp; As such, it helps us to appreciate the heritage of a soundscape that our ancestors 
							knew and that we can to some extent still hear today. 
						</p>
						<p>
							With a chapter about each bell (or group of related bells) plus some background material about bells in general, this book 
							provides excellent coverage of its subject.&nbsp; While I could have wished for more photos of the bells themselves, their absence 
							is partly explained by the relative inaccessibility of many of the bells.&nbsp; And it is more than compensated by the inclusion of 
							locator maps, tables of essential details, and a listing of the inscriptions on surviving or otherwise known bells. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Altogether, this book is a fine example of what historians elsewhere could do to document and preserve an important but often under-appreciated 
							part of our heritage. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Other reviews are available at the book's listing on the Websites of both Amazon and Barnes & Noble.

				<book-review bookTitle="Historic Alabama Bells"
							 author="Thomas Kaufmann"
							 publisherInfo="The History Press, Charleston, South Carolina, USA, 2019"
							 isbn="978-1-4671-4495-7"
							 materialInfo='6"x9", paperback, 160pp'

					<div slot="review-text">
						<p>
							This well-written book begins with an introductory chapter, followed by one which 
							briefly identifies and locates ten early bells, ranging from an 1847 Meneely to an 
							1881 McShane, and including an 1849 T.I.Dyre Jr. and an 1848 Regester &amp; Webb.&nbsp;
							The next eight chapters alternate between the history of a significant American 
							bell foundry and an Alabama example of its work:&nbsp; Revere, 1828; Hooper, 1859; 
							Blake, 1880 &amp; 1894; Wilbank, 1841.&nbsp; A chapter about the Liberty Bell (both 
							the original's visit to the state in 1885 and the 1950 Paccard reproduction) is followed 
							by twelve chapters in which the historical significance of both an old bell and the 
							building in which it is located are covered.&nbsp; A concluding chapter expresses hope 
							for the installation of real bells in currently empty bell towers.
						</p>
						<p>
							The book is filled with interesting black-and-white photographs of bells and buildings.&nbsp;
							Unfortunately, many of those depicting bell inscriptions are almost impossible to decipher.&nbsp;
							This is only partly because bells are inherently low-contrast subjects for photography.
						</p>
						<p>
							No typographical errors were noted, and only three very minor errors of substance.&nbsp;
							The 1887 McShane bell pictured on page 34 is not connected to a place (unless the year is 
							a typo).&nbsp; The location of the C.S.Bell foundry (mentioned on page 37) was in Hillsboro 
							(not Hillsborough), Ohio.&nbsp; The proprietorship of the Buckeye Bell Foundry in 1876 (mentioned 
							twice on page 143) was not "Vanduzen Tift" but the partnership of E.W.Vanduzen and C.T.Tift, 
							commonly shown on their bells as "Vanduzen &amp; Tift".&nbsp;
						</p>
						<p>
							The author's expertise as an architectural historian shines through in the relatively 
							extensive coverage of the histories of the buildings which house the listed bells.&nbsp;
							That emphasis on history might explain the general lack of technical information about 
							these bells, such as weights, sizes, and musical notes.&nbsp; That might also explain the 
							curious shift of emphasis from foundry histories in the first half of the book to building 
							histories in the second half of the book.&nbsp; It would have benefitted from more information 
							about the histories of Naylor Vickers of England, the two Meneely foundries of New York state, 
							McShane of Baltimore and Buckeye of Cincinnati, as well as the significant differences between 
							bronze and steel bells and the changes in mounting methods through the decades of the 19th century.
						</p>
						<p>
							Nevertheless, this is a very good general interest book, which may help to stir more widespread 
							interest in the long-neglected tower bells of America.

				<book-review bookTitle="Bell Ringing - Chimes&mdash;Carillons&mdash;Handbells: the World of the Bell and the Ringer"
							 author="John Camp"
							 publisherInfo="David & Charles, Newton Abbot, Devon, 1974"
							 isbn="[old style] 0 7153 6088 4"
							 materialInfo='8.5"x5.5", hardback, 160pp, including 16pp of b/w photographs'

					<div slot="review-text">
						<p>
							The author, an English change ringer, has selected a title that may seem to imply a broader 
							coverage than this book actually has.&nbsp; With a brief introduction, 13 chapters, three 
							appendices, a bibliography and an index, it provides comprehensive coverage of all matters 
							related to change ringing, with only brief excursions into a few other ways that tower bells 
							may be rung.&nbsp; Nevertheless, his somewhat casual style of writing, along with his inclusion 
							of many interesting historical details, makes this a book of very nearly general interest.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are two graphical errors&mdash;Figure 2 (p28) fails to include a ground pulley for the bell 
							rope, and the photo on p108 (top) is upside-down.&nbsp; I do not venture to critique what is 
							written about change ringing.
						</p>
						<p>
							The reviewer's copy of this book, formerly in the holdings of the Norfolk County Library, was signed 
							by the author.
