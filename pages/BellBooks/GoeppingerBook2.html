									I am highly suspicious of the estimate of 10,000 bells for the lifetime production
									of the Holbrook foundry.&nbsp; Although the length of that lifetime might seem to 
									support such a number (82 years, comparable to the 80 years of the Meneely/Troy foundry, 
									which produced about 12,400 bells), I have not seen any evidence that the Holbrooks 
									distributed bells as widely and prolifically as the Meneelys did.&nbsp; Furthermore, 
									Holbrook never made any chimes, though such sets of bells contributed significantly
									to the numbers of bells produced by both Meneely foundries.&nbsp; That large number 
									might be credible if it included small bells such as servant call bells or horse car 
									bells, which could be manufactured rapidly in large quantities.&nbsp; These could have 
									been supplied to locksmiths and bellhangers - the nomenclature of the day for those who 
									commonly installed call bells in houses, hotels, etc.

									Bells installed at lighthouses were commonly called fog bells, because they were rung in 
									foggy conditions when the light could not be seen very far.&nbsp; In the days of sailing 
									ships, in the windless conditions associated with fog, the sound of a fog bell could be 
									heard from a long distance at sea.

							<dt>p.15, second line</dt>
								<dd>
									Bridge bells were more likely to be used to warn people that a drawbridge or turnbridge was 
									about to open to allow river or canal traffic to pass through, just as railroad crossing gongs 
									still ring today.&nbsp; For example, the Meneely/Troy foundry supplied a total of 19 bells of 
									approximately 100 pounds each to the city of Chicago for use as bridge bells, undoubtedly for 
									the early versions of the many canal and river bridges in that city.
								</dd>
							<dt>p.15, Locations of American Bell Foundries</dt>
								<dd>
									A number of bell and brass foundries, most notably that of Andrew Fulton, operated in Pittsburgh, 
									Pennsylvania, from the early 1800s, supplying not only church bells but also ship's bells for the 
									vast number of steamboats that were built there to carry merchandise and raw materials up and down 
									the Ohio River. <br />
									Saint Louis, Missouri, became a major center for bell production after the Civil War, as railroads 
									enabled the shipment of all kinds of durable goods from there to the towns and cities that were 
									springing up all over the Midwest.&nbsp; From 1863 through 1878 there were never less than four 
									bellfoundries in operation simultaneously in this city, and in some years there were as many as 
									seven.&nbsp; Thereafter there were two to four bellfoundries in operation simultaneously up until the 
									Great Depression.

									This might better be captioned "Bell Fittings," as it identifies important parts of the equipment 
									associated with a bell, and normally supplied by the bell's manufacturer.
								</dd>
							<dt>p.19, Components of a Bell</dt>
								<dd>
									The text identifies a crown as an extension of the top of a bell, used for fastening it to a yoke or 
									something else.&nbsp; But it doesn't identify two other types of extension that have the same function,
									though they are pictured and described elsewhere in the book.&nbsp; One is the TANG, a flat extension 
									with a hole cross-wise through it; this is mentioned and described at the bottom of page 29, and seen in 
									the photo on page 153.&nbsp; The Holbrook bell pictured on page 7 and page 107 has a tang, fitted into a 
									socket carved into the wooden yoke (headstock) with a single cross-pin to secure it.&nbsp; The Wilbank bell
									pictured on page 168 has a wider tang with two holes.&nbsp; The other type of extension is the NECK, a 
									tapered cone that wedges into a tapered socket in a cast iron yoke.&nbsp; It is effectively described, 
									though not named, on pages 33-34.&nbsp; The mounting for the Hooper bell shown in fig.75 could be described 
									as a hybrid of neck and tang; I would call it a cylindrical neck or cylindrical tang.&nbsp; There are also 
									several variants of the crown, which do not seem to have distinct names.&nbsp; They differ in the number and 
									orientation of the cannons, the presence or absence of the argent, etc. There is also a major variation on 
									the crown called a BUTTON TOP - a solid flange on top of a short thick neck.&nbsp; It does not seem to be 
									illustrated in this book, but was commonly used on European-made cast steel bells.
								</dd>
							<dt>p.19, para.1</dt>
								<dd>
									It is true that in some places, bells were hung by chains through their crowns and rung by a clapper rope.&nbsp;
									However, it was (and is) far more common for the crown to be used to attach the bell to a headstock so that it 
									could be swung.&nbsp; The earliest method of attachment was blacksmithed straps, bent through the loops of the 
									cannons and affixed to a timber headstock; but eventually these straps were superseded by various kinds of 
									bolts.&nbsp; Even today, bells can be made with crowns and hung by this method.
								</dd>
							<dt>p.19, para.6</dt>
								<dd>
									Yoke is a distinctively American term, derived from the similarity of shape to the yoke of a draft animal (ox, 
									horse or mule).&nbsp; In European terms, the American yoke would be called a tucked-up headstock (as opposed to 
									a straight headstock).&nbsp; "Tucked-up" refers to where the top of the bell is with respect to the axis of rotation
									when swinging (which is always through the gudgeons).&nbsp; German-made swinging bells, some of which have been 
									imported to America, are almost always hung from straight headstocks.
								</dd>
							<dt>p.19, para.6</dt>
								<dd>
									The use of A-frames to support American swinging bells began about the middle of the 19th century, as iron-casting 
									technology was improving.&nbsp; Prior to that, bell makers commonly shipped a bell with a yoke and a pair of bearing 
									blocks, leaving to a local carpenter the job of building a timber frame to support the bell, and integrating it into 
									the structure of a bell tower.&nbsp; With A-frames (or the cheaper equivalent of a vertical post with brace rods - 
									see fig.47), the bell manufacturer could mount these supports on a timber base and ship a complete assembly to the 
									destination.&nbsp; There it just needed to be hoisted into the tower and set on an existing floor or equivalent support.
								</dd>
							<dt>p.20, para.2</dt>
								<dd>
									Prior to the development of the clevis in the 19th century, American bellfounders followed the old European tradition of 
									using a cast-in CLAPPER STAPLE, possibly made of wrought iron, to support the clapper.&nbsp; The clapper was usually 
									connected to the clapper staple by a heavy leather strap.
								</dd>
							<dt>p.20, para.3</dt>
								<dd>
									Limiting springs, sometimes called CLAPPER SPRINGS, served two other purposes besides the one described by Neil.&nbsp;
									First, they prevent the clapper from lying against the bell, and thus damping the sound.&nbsp; Second, they prevent the 
									clapper from double-striking, i.e., bouncing off the bell and then striking again before the bell swings back.&nbsp;
									It should be noted that clapper springs are only required on bells with a falling clapper, not those with a flying clapper.
								</dd>
							<dt>p.21, para.2</dt>
								<dd>
									Outside tolling hammers might exist, but I have never seen one.&nbsp; What is common on the outside of a bell is a clock 
									hammer, operated by a weight-driven tower clock.&nbsp; It is shaped very much like a tolling hammer, but it is mounted so 
									that the hammer head just clears the soundbow on the side of the bell opposite to the wheel.&nbsp; (In this way, the bell 
									is free to swing without interference from the clock hammer.)&nbsp; The hammer arm rests on a flat spring, and the end of 
									the other arm is connected to a pull wire that goes down through the floor of the belfry to the clock room.&nbsp; There it 
									is connected to one end of a center-pivoted clock-strike arm, the other end of which rides on a toothed cam wheel.&nbsp;
									As the clock approaches the time when the bell should strike, a cam tooth slowly causes the clock hammer to be lifted off 
									the spring.&nbsp; When the clock-strike arm falls off the other side of the tooth, the clock hammer falls; its falling weight 
									overcomes the spring rest just enough to strike the bell once before settling on the rest again.&nbsp; The configuration of the 
									cam wheel and other parts of the clock control when and how many times the clock hammer strikes the bell.
								</dd>
							<dt>p.21, para.3</dt>
								<dd>
									While I have not seen an American-made steel bell with a crown, some of the steel bells made in England or Germany do have 
									either crowns or button tops.&nbsp; Some have reeds and lettering as well.
								</dd>
							<dt>p.25, para.2</dt>
								<dd>
									The great bell of St.Francis de Sales Catholic Church in Cincinnati is further described <A HREF="data/NAOtherGreatBells.html#OH1">here</A>,
									where a different weight is reported for it.&nbsp; (At least three different weights for this bell can be found in the literature.)
								</dd>
							<dt>p.25, Form Follows Function, second paragraph</dt>
								<dd>
									Fig.79 is an even better illustration of the point than fig.40; there is hardly any hint of a soundbow in the shape of the bell.
								</dd>
							<dt>p.27, paras.1 & 2</dt>
								<dd>
									The idea that the sound of a bell comes primarily from its mouth is a common misconception that is easily disproved.&nbsp;
									Ring a handbell, then point its mouth straight at your ear.&nbsp; Now turn your wrist 90 degrees so that the side of the 
									bell is toward your ear.&nbsp; You will hear that the bell sounds louder, even though the sound continues to decay.&nbsp;
									The reason for this is that the mode of vibration in a bell is circular, and the sound waves that are emitted from the inner 
									sides of a bell tend to cancel each other.&nbsp; This is more obvious in a relatively narrow-mouthed bronze bell than in a 
									relatively wide-mouthed steel bell.&nbsp; When watching a swinging bell in an open tower, the visual image reaches the eye 
									much faster than the audible sound, but the brain wants to match the sight and sound at the moment they are received, thus 
									producing an incorrect impression of when the bell sounds loudest in its swing.&nbsp; A swinging bell sounds louder than a 
									non-swinging bell because the clapper hits the bell with much greater force.&nbsp; Trying to achieve the same loudness from a 
									stationary bell is very likely to break the bell because a tied clapper is not free to bounce after it strikes.&nbsp; It is 
									actually much easier to keep a swinging bell in motion than it is to make the same amount of sound just by moving the clapper.&nbsp;
									(A fire bell is a different matter, because there is so much more adrenaline involved!)
								</dd>
							<dt>p.29, para.4</dt>
								<dd>
									The concept of rotating a swinging bell to obtain a fresh strike point was very much a New World invention, and probably sprang 
									out of the fierce competition between bellfoundries selling into all the new settlements that were springing up across America in 
									the 19th century.&nbsp; Published testimonials from satisfied customers frequently contain remarks to the effect that "our new bell 
									is better than all the others in town!"&nbsp; And the bellfounders wanted their customers to be assured that they could easily keep 
									that pleasant sound.&nbsp; As a result, several different rotary mounting systems were developed, patented and advertised, even if in 
									practice they were seldom used.&nbsp; However, I have seen a few bells that had been rotated twice - always in Catholic churches,
									where the bells had been very heavily used.
								</dd>
							<dt>p.29, last paragraph</dt>
								<dd>
									For a long time, we thought that the Vanduzen 4-bolt mounting system was unique to that firm.&nbsp; Recently a couple of Meneely/Watervliet 
									bells have been discovered with an identical mounting.&nbsp; It is not yet known whether the Meneelys were experimenting with Vanduzen's 
									mounting system or whether these bells have been remounted on Vanduzen fittings at some time in their history.&nbsp; In any event, it makes 
									the bell-hunting campanologist much more cautious about identifying a bell solely with binoculars, though they remain an essential research tool.

								<dd>
									"U-shaped cups" refers to the open plain bearings used on most small steel bells (whether mounted on forks or A-frames) and on many small 
									bronze bells.&nbsp; These plain bearings could operate for many years without any lubrication at all, because their loading (in terms of 
									pounds per square inch of contact surface) was very low, so frictional wear was minimal once the gudgeon and bearing cup had worn each 
									other smooth.&nbsp; Middle-sized bells with plain bearings often had hold-down straps bolted across the tops of the bearing cups to prevent 
									the bell from jumping out of its bearings if the rope was mis-handled.&nbsp; More complex bearings (e.g., roller boxes) required regular 
									lubrication for easy operation.
								</dd>
							<dt>p.33, Bronze Bell Restoration, first paragraph</dt>
								<dd>
									I heartily agree with Neil's recommendation against removing the patina of a bronze bell.&nbsp; To me, it's like making your granny get a 
									facelift because you don't like looking at her wrinkles.&nbsp; An old bell ought to be respected for what it is, rather than making it look 
									like new.&nbsp; (A brass railroad bell or a chrome-plated fire engine bell is different - it's a piece of equipment which was regularly polished 
									while in use.)

								The two-part molding method, using a perforated metal cask to hold the outer part, is accurately described.&nbsp; This is a relatively modern

								top of the false bell is still used by some foundries.&nbsp; Details of this method can also be found in the literature.

								The database from which this Part of the book was produced served well for many years as an efficient and effective means of compiling 
								and organizing information about all of the various names found on bells or in documentation about their makers.&nbsp; Its one shortcoming 
								is that finding and connecting the various names used by a single foundry (or its various proprietorships) over the course of its existence 
								is somewhat awkward.&nbsp; The Successor field identified in the author's second Tip is helpful in this respect, as is the corresponding 
								Predecessor field.&nbsp; When an entry has both a Year Closed and a Successor, it should not be assumed that the business was actually closed; 
								more likely that is the year when the Successor took over its operation as a new proprietor.

							<dt>p.74, Gardiner Campbell & Sons</dt>
								<dd>
									<I>Commentary:</I>&nbsp; To be consistent with the style used in the rest of this book there should be three entries for this 
									foundry, corresponding to the various business names that appear in the Milwaukee city directories: <br/>
									Gardiner Campbell & Son, 237-239 Oregon (1876-1879) <br/>
									Gardiner Campbell & Sons, 237-239 Oregon (1880), 242-246 Oregon (1881-1886), 238-246 Oregon (1887-1888), 238-256 Oregon (1889-1899) <br/>
									Gardiner Campbell Co., 238-256 Oregon (1900-1904) <br/>
									Gardiner Campbell was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, in 1834.&nbsp; He emigrated to America in 1850 with his parents and three 
									siblings, having just completed an apprenticeship in a bell and iron foundry in his home town.&nbsp; Settling in Milwaukee, he 
									worked for a variety of iron foundries while starting a family.&nbsp; When his older son (George Gardiner Campbell) was 18, he 
									started his own iron foundry, with George as his partner.&nbsp; Four years later, his younger son (Henry Edward Campbell) joined 
									the firm, prompting its first change of name; in the same year, the business was first classified under Bell Foundries in the 
									business section of the city directories.&nbsp; Following the death of Gardiner Campbell in 1892, his sons retained the company 
									name unchanged.&nbsp; It survived the nationwide fiscal panic of 1893, and went on to cast the mammoth bell that still rings 
									from the tower of the Milwaukee City Hall.&nbsp; But the untimely death of George G. Campbell in 1898 (drowned in a diving bell 
									accident) was a catastrophe in more ways than one.&nbsp; The reorganization of the business in 1900, with outside investors as 
									officers of a new corporation, was insufficient to keep it going, and it ceased operations in 1904. <br/>
									This is the only verified instance of an American firm operating both a bellfoundry and an iron foundry.

								<dd><I>Source:</I>&nbsp; add: Cincinnati city directories (annual) </dd>
								<dd>
									<I>Commentary:</I>&nbsp; In the city directories for Cincinnati, an 1884 advertisement for The Blymyer Manufacturing Company includes 
									Bells among the many kinds of durable goods that they produced.&nbsp; In the 1885 directory, the Cincinnati Bell Foundry Company first 
									occurs, with an advertisement identifying it as "Successor (in Bells) to The Blymyer Manufacturing Company" (which continued to exist).&nbsp;
									Clearly, BMCo spun off its bell-making business into a separate company.&nbsp; D.W. Blymyer was president of CBFCo and also a partner in 
									Blymyer Mfg. Co.&nbsp; In 1919, an advertisement for The Cincinnati Bell Foundry Company boasts of "Blymyer Church Bells."&nbsp; The last 
									city directory in which CBFCo was listed was 1925.&nbsp; There is no evidence that a separate firm named Cincinnati Bell Company ever
									existed, so the use of CIN BELL CO on bells must have been a form of abbreviation. <br/>
									The John B. Morris Foundry Company was indeed a Cincinnati firm, but the 1918 city directory identifies them as proprietors of the Eagle 
									Iron Foundry and Machine Works, which occupied a full city block that was nowhere near the Cincinnati Bell Foundry Company.&nbsp; None of 
									the principals of the Morris firm have been found to be associated with any of the Blymyer firms.&nbsp; It is conceivable that the Eagle 
									foundry could have been a subcontractor for CBFCo, but that does not seem to be sufficient justification for them to claim proprietorship
									of it.&nbsp; So this remains a mystery for the time being.

								<dd>
									<i>Commentary:&nbsp;</i>Although I am credited as a source for this information, I cannot now find any record of what I may have sent 
									to Neil years ago.&nbsp; At present, I do not believe there was ever a person named C.A.Coffin associated with the Buckeye Bell Foundry, 
									nor even such a resident in the city of Cincinnati.&nbsp; An advertisement in the 1866 city directory makes it very clear that the 
									partnership of Vanduzen & Tift  was the direct successor of G.W. Coffin & Co. as the proprietors of the Buckeye Bell Foundry.&nbsp;
									G.W.Coffin retired from business at that point, and lived for several years thereafter.

							<dt>p.80, G. W. Coffin</dt>
								<dd><I>Successor:</I>&nbsp; Vanduzen & Tift (see preceding Commentary)</dd>

									<I>Other Facts:</I>&nbsp; I have been unable to find any documentation verifying the existence of a person named W.A. Van Duzen (or 
									Vanduzen), whether in Cincinnati or in Ezra W. Vanduzen's family tree. <br/>
									The last sentence seems to imply that Vanduzen & Tift were not involved with the foundry before they bought out G.W.Coffin.&nbsp;
									On the contrary, they had been partners with him in that enterprise since at least as early as 1860, and so would merely have bought 
									out his share of the partnership when he retired.
								</dd>
								<dd>
									<I>Commentary:</I>&nbsp; G.W.Coffin produced bells which were far more ornately decorated than anything made by any other American 
									bellfounder.&nbsp; The photo on this page does not show his most ornate style, which had fancy sculptural reliefs repeating around 
									the waist of the bell.

								<dd><I>Years Known in Operation:</I>&nbsp; 1843-1864</dd>
								<dd>
									<I>Founder:</I>&nbsp; Adam Good (born 1812 in Bavaria as Adam Guth, died 1877 in Titusville PA) and various partners (see Other 
									Facts here).

								<dd><I>Source:</I> City directories and newspapers of Buffalo, NY, 1832-1877.</dd>
								<dd>
									<I>Other Facts:</I>&nbsp; The Guth family, including Adam, his parents and at least one sibling, immigrated to America in the 1830s, 
									and were settled in Buffalo by 1836.&nbsp; His father operated a grocery store, and the family tried a couple of ways of Americanizing 
									their name before settling on Good.&nbsp; At the same time, a blacksmith and brass founder named John Cummings set up shop on the corner 
									of Ohio and Washington streets in Buffalo, and a locksmith named John G. Davock was at work in the city.&nbsp;  It's not known where 
									Adam learned the brassfounding trade, but by 1838 he had set up his own shop next door to his father's grocery.&nbsp; About that same time, 
									John Cummings had taken into partnership a man named Stephen Clark.&nbsp; By the next year, Adam Good had taken Clark's place as junior 
									partner at Ohio & Washington.&nbsp; This also did not last long, as Adam Good became a parter of John W. Davock, a lock maker and bell 
									hanger, at the latter's shop at Washington & Swan streets, while John Cummings retained the property at Ohio & Washington as a 
									blacksmith.&nbsp; By 1841, Cummings had relocated his blacksmith shop to Main street; it is not known how the property at Ohio & Washington 
									was then being used.&nbsp;  However, by 1842, the partnership of Davock & Good had broken up, and Adam Good was operating a brass foundry 
									on that property; he remained there for almost two decades.&nbsp; By March of 1843, he had erected a furnace for the casting of large bells and
									heavy pieces for machinery (probably iron, not brass); he advertised this expanded capability under the name Lafayette Bell and Brass Foundry 
									(see p.119 below).&nbsp; In 1849-50 he was spelling his last name as "Goode," but thereafter he reverted to "Good."&nbsp; By 1858, Adam had 
									diversified beyond bells & brass into the manufacture of steam engines, thus implying that he was capable of casting iron as well as
									brass and bronze.&nbsp; An 1859 article reported that his firm also had a division dedicated to the production of hose and belting (leather 
									products).&nbsp; Another article that year reported that he had taken all of the premiums and prizes for Steam Engines at a recent Missouri 
									Fair held in St.Louis.&nbsp; In 1861, it was reported that he had already shipped 24 steam engines of five to eight horsepower to Tidioute and 
									Titusville in the Pennsylvania oil region, as well as setting up his own oil refinery in Buffalo in connection with the "extensive oil districts 
									in the vicinity" of that city.&nbsp; Adam continued to own the Ohio Street property after he removed to Pennsylvania in 1864; it was apparently 
									leased to the firm of Farrar, Trefts and Knight, who continued the engine-building operation but not the bellfounding operation, and used the 
									Lafayette name as well.&nbsp; In Titusville, Adam Good set up another Lafayette Iron Works and Brass Foundry, which included a machine shop; he 
									also constructed and leased office and hotel buildings, and set up a grist or flouring mill.&nbsp; It is not known whether he ever made any bells 
									in Titusville.

								</dd>
								<dd>
									<I>Commentary:</I>&nbsp; While Benjamin Hanks' father (Uriah Hanks) came from near Duxbury, Massachusetts (there is no Duxbury in 
									Connecticut), he was married in Mansfield, Connecticut, in 1755, and Benjamin was born there in 1757.&nbsp; All of Benjamin's siblings 
									were also born in Mansfield, the last in 1782.&nbsp; Benjamin is reported to have lived and worked in Windham CT from 1777 to 1779,
									in Litchfield CT from 1779 to 1790, and then in Ashford CT briefly before returning to Mansfield.&nbsp; Windham and Ashford are not far 
									from Mansfield, but Litchfield is on the other side of the state.&nbsp; Oddly, all nine of his children seem to have been born in 
									Mansfield.&nbsp; While he might have cast some bells while in Litchfield, we have seen no evidence of that.&nbsp; Thus the years of 
									operation of his foundry in Mansfield should be at most 1790-1808, and probably less.

										This is almost certainly an illustration of the 13-bell chime made for Christ Church, Cambridge, in 1860; possibly it was made from a 
										photograph.&nbsp; It shows the chime set up in the yard of the foundry, surrounded by the workers and management.&nbsp; A narrow sign 
										just above the topmost bells reads, "Cast by Henry N. Hooper & Co. Boston".&nbsp; Two things are especially notable about the chime as 
										shown here.&nbsp; <br/>
										Firstly, the chime-playing mechanism, located on the upper deck with four top-hatted gentlemen, is a taut-rope chiming rack.&nbsp;
										(That could be loosely described as an Ellacombe rack, though the construction is somewhat different.)&nbsp; Oddly, only 10 ropes are 
										visible below the deck, and only 10 note names are shown on the top rail of the rack.&nbsp; <br/>
										Secondly, eight bells are hung for swinging - possibly a diatonic octave on the tenor (which is in the independent frame at left).&nbsp;
										While this might seem to suggest, or to be inspired by, the idea of change-ringing (e.g., at Old North Church in Boston), these bells 
										clearly have no stays, and thus could not safely be rung full-circle.

									<I>Commentary:</I>&nbsp; The McShane Bell Foundry Company was not the successor to Regester & Webb; the McShane foundry and the Regester foundry operated in competition

									<i>Commentary:&nbsp;</i> Charles T. Robinson apparently seized control of the foundry that had been operated by Blake & Company sometime 
									in early 1888; the Boston city directory for that year not only lists both firms at the same address, but it contains advertisements from both 
									of them using the same Hooper & Co. graphic!&nbsp; The Robinson firm claimed to be the successor of the Blake firm, and at least three single 
									bells (dated 1888 or 1889) are known to bear the name of C.T.Robinson & Co.&nbsp; This did not last long; though William S. Blake was apparently 
									unemployed as of the time the 1889 directory was compiled, by the time of the 1890 directory compilation Robinson was gone and William S. Blake 
									was back running the foundry, this time under the name of Blake Bell Company.&nbsp; No additional evidence has been found to identify or distinguish 
									this Charles T. Robinson from several others that were living in the USA around this time period.&nbsp; For more about the complex history of this 
									foundry, see our <A HREF="data/IXfoundryHooperBlake.html">Hooper/Blake index page</A>.

									because no bells bearing the Simmons name have been reported.&nbsp; It is not known when Simmons began retailing bells nor when they stopped doing so.&nbsp; City 
									directories show that Simmons was initially a wholesaler of hardware and cutlery; the company later expanded into retail operations and advertised house furnishing goods,
									sporting goods and bicycles as their major product lines.

								<dd>
									<i>Commentary:&nbsp;</i> This entry is very puzzling, because there appears to be no mention of a W.A. Vanduzen in the Cincinnati city directories of the day.&nbsp; The first mention 
									of any Vanduzen connected with foundry work occurs in 1853, when E.W. Vanduzen was identified as a bell founder (living across the river in Newport).&nbsp; By 1860, Ezra W. Vanduzen 
									and Cornelius Tacitus Tift were partners in G.W.Coffin & Company, and after the retirement of G.W. Coffin, they were the principals of Vanduzen & Tift.&nbsp; Ezra's middle name was 
									Williams, after his paternal grandmother's maiden name, so it is highly unlikely that he changed his name from W.A. to E.W.&nbsp; It's a mystery!

									<i>Commentary:&nbsp;</i> At least two of the three bells listed are equipped with a novel train of gears designed to rotate the bell slightly each time it swings, using a large horizontal 
									gear between the top of the bell and the yoke.&nbsp; (See the article on this foundry in Vol.80, Nr.2 of <i>The Bell Tower,</i> March-April 2020.)&nbsp; No other maker of tower bells ever

									<i>Commentary:</I> The Hartford (Connecticut) city directory for 1828 identifies the partnership of Ward, Bartholomew & Brainard as proprietors of a Hardware store located on main street at 
									#229.&nbsp; While the partners are not explicitly identified, the same directory identifies three men of appropriate name who were Copper-smiths located nearby on main street, as follows:&nbsp;
									James Ward, at #238; Roswell Bartholomew, at #228; and Charles Brainard, at #232.&nbsp; Also, a bell made by [James] Doolittle of Hartford in 1827 bears the additional inscription "FOR W B & B".&nbsp;
									Thus it appears likely that W B & B were resellers, not bellfounders.
