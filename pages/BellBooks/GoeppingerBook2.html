						and that if your copy is from the first printing, then you have already posted the corrections
						from that page to your copy of the book.&nbsp; Thus whether you have a corrected copy of the
						first printing or a copy of the second printing, the rest of this page is now relevant to
						you.&nbsp; Pagination of the two printings is identical.

						A few additional errata were discovered after the second printing; these are included with the

							I am highly suspicious of the estimate of 10,000 bells for the lifetime production
							of the Holbrook foundry.&nbsp; Although the length of that lifetime might seem to
							support such a number (82 years, comparable to the 80 years of the Meneely/Troy foundry,
							which produced about 12,400 bells), I have not seen any evidence that the Holbrooks
							distributed bells as widely and prolifically as the Meneelys did.&nbsp; Furthermore,
							Holbrook never made any chimes, though such sets of bells contributed significantly
							to the numbers of bells produced by both Meneely foundries.&nbsp; That large number
							might be credible if it included small bells such as servant call bells or horse car
							bells, which could be manufactured rapidly in large quantities.&nbsp; These could have
							been supplied to locksmiths and bellhangers - the nomenclature of the day for those who
							commonly installed call bells in houses, hotels, etc.

							Bells installed at lighthouses were commonly called fog bells, because they were rung in
							foggy conditions when the light could not be seen very far.&nbsp; In the days of sailing
							ships, in the windless conditions associated with fog, the sound of a fog bell could be
							heard from a long distance at sea.

						<dd>
							Bridge bells were more likely to be used to warn people that a drawbridge or turnbridge was
							about to open to allow river or canal traffic to pass through, just as railroad crossing
							gongs still ring today.&nbsp; For example, the Meneely/Troy foundry supplied a total of 19
							bells of approximately 100 pounds each to the city of Chicago for use as bridge bells,
							undoubtedly for the early versions of the many canal and river bridges in that city.
						</dd>
						<dt>p.15, Locations of American Bell Foundries</dt>
						<dd>
							A number of bell and brass foundries, most notably that of Andrew Fulton, operated in
							Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from the early 1800s, supplying not only church bells but also
							ship's bells for the vast number of steamboats that were built there to carry merchandise
							and raw materials up and down the Ohio River. <br />
							Saint Louis, Missouri, became a major center for bell production after the Civil War, as
							railroads enabled the shipment of all kinds of durable goods from there to the towns and
							cities that were springing up all over the Midwest.&nbsp; From 1863 through 1878 there were
							never less than four bellfoundries in operation simultaneously in this city, and in some
							years there were as many as seven.&nbsp; Thereafter there were two to four bellfoundries in
							operation simultaneously up until the Great Depression.

							This might better be captioned "Bell Fittings," as it identifies important parts of the

						<dd>
							The text identifies a crown as an extension of the top of a bell, used for fastening it to a
							yoke or something else.&nbsp; But it doesn't identify two other types of extension that have
							the same function, though they are pictured and described elsewhere in the book.&nbsp; One
							is the TANG, a flat extension with a hole cross-wise through it; this is mentioned and
							described at the bottom of page 29, and seen in the photo on page 153.&nbsp; The Holbrook
							bell pictured on page 7 and page 107 has a tang, fitted into a socket carved into the wooden
							yoke (headstock) with a single cross-pin to secure it.&nbsp; The Wilbank bell pictured on
							page 168 has a wider tang with two holes.&nbsp; The other type of extension is the NECK, a
							tapered cone that wedges into a tapered socket in a cast iron yoke.&nbsp; It is effectively
							described, though not named, on pages 33-34.&nbsp; The mounting for the Hooper bell shown in
							fig.75 could be described as a hybrid of neck and tang; I would call it a cylindrical neck
							or cylindrical tang.&nbsp; There are also several variants of the crown, which do not seem
							to have distinct names.&nbsp; They differ in the number and orientation of the cannons, the
							presence or absence of the argent, etc. There is also a major variation on the crown called
							a BUTTON TOP - a solid flange on top of a short thick neck.&nbsp; It does not seem to be
							illustrated in this book, but was commonly used on European-made cast steel bells.
						</dd>
						<dt>p.19, para.1</dt>
						<dd>
							It is true that in some places, bells were hung by chains through their crowns and rung by a
							clapper rope.&nbsp; However, it was (and is) far more common for the crown to be used to
							attach the bell to a headstock so that it could be swung.&nbsp; The earliest method of
							attachment was blacksmithed straps, bent through the loops of the cannons and affixed to a
							timber headstock; but eventually these straps were superseded by various kinds of
							bolts.&nbsp; Even today, bells can be made with crowns and hung by this method.
						</dd>
						<dt>p.19, para.6</dt>
						<dd>
							Yoke is a distinctively American term, derived from the similarity of shape to the yoke of a
							draft animal (ox, horse or mule).&nbsp; In European terms, the American yoke would be called
							a tucked-up headstock (as opposed to a straight headstock).&nbsp; "Tucked-up" refers to
							where the top of the bell is with respect to the axis of rotation when swinging (which is
							always through the gudgeons).&nbsp; German-made swinging bells, some of which have been
							imported to America, are almost always hung from straight headstocks.
						</dd>
						<dt>p.19, para.6</dt>
						<dd>
							The use of A-frames to support American swinging bells began about the middle of the 19th
							century, as iron-casting technology was improving.&nbsp; Prior to that, bell makers commonly
							shipped a bell with a yoke and a pair of bearing blocks, leaving to a local carpenter the
							job of building a timber frame to support the bell, and integrating it into the structure of
							a bell tower.&nbsp; With A-frames (or the cheaper equivalent of a vertical post with brace
							rods - see fig.47), the bell manufacturer could mount these supports on a timber base and
							ship a complete assembly to the destination.&nbsp; There it just needed to be hoisted into
							the tower and set on an existing floor or equivalent support.
						</dd>
						<dt>p.20, para.2</dt>
						<dd>
							Prior to the development of the clevis in the 19th century, American bellfounders followed
							the old European tradition of using a cast-in CLAPPER STAPLE, possibly made of wrought iron,
							to support the clapper.&nbsp; The clapper was usually connected to the clapper staple by a
							heavy leather strap.
						</dd>
						<dt>p.20, para.3</dt>
						<dd>
							Limiting springs, sometimes called CLAPPER SPRINGS, served two other purposes besides the
							one described by Neil.&nbsp; First, they prevent the clapper from lying against the bell,
							and thus damping the sound.&nbsp; Second, they prevent the clapper from double-striking,
							i.e., bouncing off the bell and then striking again before the bell swings back.&nbsp;
							It should be noted that clapper springs are only required on bells with a falling clapper,
							not those with a flying clapper.
						</dd>
						<dt>p.21, para.2</dt>
						<dd>
							Outside tolling hammers might exist, but I have never seen one.&nbsp; What is common on the
							outside of a bell is a clock hammer, operated by a weight-driven tower clock.&nbsp; It is
							shaped very much like a tolling hammer, but it is mounted so that the hammer head just
							clears the soundbow on the side of the bell opposite to the wheel.&nbsp; (In this way, the
							bell is free to swing without interference from the clock hammer.)&nbsp; The hammer arm
							rests on a flat spring, and the end of the other arm is connected to a pull wire that goes
							down through the floor of the belfry to the clock room.&nbsp; There it is connected to one
							end of a center-pivoted clock-strike arm, the other end of which rides on a toothed cam
							wheel.&nbsp; As the clock approaches the time when the bell should strike, a cam tooth
							slowly causes the clock hammer to be lifted off the spring.&nbsp; When the clock-strike arm
							falls off the other side of the tooth, the clock hammer falls; its falling weight overcomes
							the spring rest just enough to strike the bell once before settling on the rest
							again.&nbsp; The configuration of the cam wheel and other parts of the clock control when
							and how many times the clock hammer strikes the bell.
						</dd>
						<dt>p.21, para.3</dt>
						<dd>
							While I have not seen an American-made steel bell with a crown, some of the steel bells made
							in England or Germany do have either crowns or button tops.&nbsp; Some have reeds and
							lettering as well.
						</dd>
						<dt>p.25, para.2</dt>
						<dd>
							The great bell of St.Francis de Sales Catholic Church in Cincinnati is further described
							<a href="/data/NAOtherGreatBells.html#OH1">here</a>, where a different weight is reported
							for it.&nbsp; (At least three different weights for this bell can be found in the
							literature.)
						</dd>
						<dt>p.25, Form Follows Function, second paragraph</dt>
						<dd>
							Fig.79 is an even better illustration of the point than fig.40; there is hardly any hint of
							a soundbow in the shape of the bell.
						</dd>
						<dt>p.27, paras.1 & 2</dt>
						<dd>
							The idea that the sound of a bell comes primarily from its mouth is a common misconception
							that is easily disproved.&nbsp; Ring a handbell, then point its mouth straight at your
							ear.&nbsp; Now turn your wrist 90 degrees so that the side of the bell is toward your
							ear.&nbsp; You will hear that the bell sounds louder, even though the sound continues to
							decay.&nbsp; The reason for this is that the mode of vibration in a bell is circular, and
							the sound waves that are emitted from the inner sides of a bell tend to cancel each
							other.&nbsp; This is more obvious in a relatively narrow-mouthed bronze bell than in a
							relatively wide-mouthed steel bell.&nbsp; When watching a swinging bell in an open tower,
							the visual image reaches the eye much faster than the audible sound, but the brain wants to
							match the sight and sound at the moment they are received, thus producing an incorrect
							impression of when the bell sounds loudest in its swing.&nbsp; A swinging bell sounds louder
							than a non-swinging bell because the clapper hits the bell with much greater force.&nbsp;
							Trying to achieve the same loudness from a stationary bell is very likely to break the bell
							because a tied clapper is not free to bounce after it strikes.&nbsp; It is actually much
							easier to keep a swinging bell in motion than it is to make the same amount of sound just by
							moving the clapper.&nbsp; (A fire bell is a different matter, because there is so much more
							adrenaline involved!)
						</dd>
						<dt>p.29, para.4</dt>
						<dd>
							The concept of rotating a swinging bell to obtain a fresh strike point was very much a New
							World invention, and probably sprang out of the fierce competition between bellfoundries
							selling into all the new settlements that were springing up across America in the 19th
							century.&nbsp; Published testimonials from satisfied customers frequently contain remarks to
							the effect that "our new bell is better than all the others in town!"&nbsp; And the
							bellfounders wanted their customers to be assured that they could easily keep that pleasant
							sound.&nbsp; As a result, several different rotary mounting systems were developed, patented
							and advertised, even if in practice they were seldom used.&nbsp; However, I have seen a few
							bells that had been rotated twice - always in Catholic churches, where the bells had been
							very heavily used.
						</dd>
						<dt>p.29, last paragraph</dt>
						<dd>
							For a long time, we thought that the Vanduzen 4-bolt mounting system was unique to that
							firm.&nbsp; Recently a couple of Meneely/Watervliet bells have been discovered with an
							identical mounting.&nbsp; It is not yet known whether the Meneelys were experimenting with
							Vanduzen's mounting system or whether these bells have been remounted on Vanduzen fittings
							at some time in their history.&nbsp; In any event, it makes the bell-hunting campanologist
							much more cautious about identifying a bell solely with binoculars, though they remain an
							essential research tool.

							"U-shaped cups" refers to the open plain bearings used on most small steel bells (whether
							mounted on forks or A-frames) and on many small bronze bells.&nbsp; These plain bearings
							could operate for many years without any lubrication at all, because their loading (in terms
							of pounds per square inch of contact surface) was very low, so frictional wear was minimal
							once the gudgeon and bearing cup had worn each other smooth.&nbsp; Middle-sized bells with
							plain bearings often had hold-down straps bolted across the tops of the bearing cups to
							prevent the bell from jumping out of its bearings if the rope was mis-handled.&nbsp; More
							complex bearings (e.g., roller boxes) required regular lubrication for easy operation.
						</dd>
						<dt>p.33, Bronze Bell Restoration, first paragraph</dt>
						<dd>
							I heartily agree with Neil's recommendation against removing the patina of a bronze
							bell.&nbsp; To me, it's like making your granny get a facelift because you don't like
							looking at her wrinkles.&nbsp; An old bell ought to be respected for what it is, rather than
							making it look like new.&nbsp; (A brass railroad bell or a chrome-plated fire engine bell is
							different - it's a piece of equipment which was regularly polished while in use.)

							The database from which this Part of the book was produced served well for many years as an

							various names found on bells or in documentation about their makers.&nbsp; Its one
							shortcoming is that finding and connecting the various names used by a single foundry (or
							its various proprietorships) over the course of its existence is somewhat awkward.&nbsp; The
							Successor field identified in the author's second Tip is helpful in this respect, as is the
							corresponding Predecessor field.&nbsp; When an entry has both a Year Closed and a Successor,

							<b>Commentary:</b>&nbsp; To be consistent with the style used in the rest of this book there

							Gardiner Campbell & Son, 237-239 Oregon (1876-1879) <br />

							Gardiner Campbell & Sons, 237-239 Oregon (1880), 242-246 Oregon (1881-1886), 238-246 Oregon

							Gardiner Campbell Co., 238-256 Oregon (1900-1904) <br />

							Gardiner Campbell was born in Dunfermline, Scotland, in 1834.&nbsp; He emigrated to America
							in 1850 with his parents and three siblings, having just completed an apprenticeship in a
							bell and iron foundry in his home town.&nbsp; Settling in Milwaukee, he worked for a variety
							of iron foundries while starting a family.&nbsp; When his older son (George Gardiner
							Campbell) was 18, he started his own iron foundry, with George as his partner.&nbsp; Four
							years later, his younger son (Henry Edward Campbell) joined the firm, prompting its first
							change of name; in the same year, the business was first classified under Bell Foundries in
							the business section of the city directories.&nbsp; Following the death of Gardiner Campbell
							in 1892, his sons retained the company name unchanged.&nbsp; It survived the nationwide
							fiscal panic of 1893, and went on to cast the mammoth bell that still rings from the tower
							of the Milwaukee City Hall.&nbsp; But the untimely death of George G. Campbell in 1898
							(drowned in a diving bell accident) was a catastrophe in more ways than one.&nbsp; The
							reorganization of the business in 1900, with outside investors as officers of a new
							corporation, was insufficient to keep it going, and it ceased operations
							in 1904. <br />

							This is the only verified instance of an American firm operating both a bellfoundry and an
							iron foundry.

							<b>Commentary:</b>&nbsp; In the city directories for Cincinnati, an 1884 advertisement for
							The Blymyer Manufacturing Company includes Bells among the many kinds of durable goods that
							they produced.&nbsp; In the 1885 directory, the Cincinnati Bell Foundry Company first
							occurs, with an advertisement identifying it as "Successor (in Bells) to The Blymyer
							Manufacturing Company" (which continued to exist).&nbsp; Clearly, BMCo spun off its
							bell-making business into a separate company.&nbsp; D.W. Blymyer was president of CBFCo and
							also a partner in Blymyer Mfg. Co.&nbsp; In 1919, an advertisement for The Cincinnati Bell
							Foundry Company boasts of "Blymyer Church Bells."&nbsp; The last city directory in which
							CBFCo was listed was 1925.&nbsp; There is no evidence that a separate firm named Cincinnati
							Bell Company ever existed, so the use of CIN BELL CO on bells must have been a form of
							abbreviation. <br />

							The John B. Morris Foundry Company was indeed a Cincinnati firm, but the 1918 city directory
							identifies them as proprietors of the Eagle Iron Foundry and Machine Works, which occupied a
							full city block that was nowhere near the Cincinnati Bell Foundry Company.&nbsp; None of the
							principals of the Morris firm have been found to be associated with any of the Blymyer
							firms.&nbsp; It is conceivable that the Eagle foundry could have been a subcontractor for
							CBFCo, but that does not seem to be sufficient justification for them to claim
							proprietorship of it.&nbsp; So this remains a mystery for the time being.

						<dd>
							<b>Other Facts:</b>&nbsp; The Guth family, including Adam, his parents and at least one
							sibling, immigrated to America in the 1830s, and were settled in Buffalo by 1836.&nbsp; His
							father operated a grocery store, and the family tried a couple of ways of Americanizing
							their name before settling on Good.&nbsp; At the same time, a blacksmith and brass founder
							named John Cummings set up shop on the corner of Ohio and Washington streets in Buffalo, and
							a locksmith named John G. Davock was at work in the city.&nbsp; It's not known where Adam
							learned the brassfounding trade, but by 1838 he had set up his own shop next door to his
							father's grocery.&nbsp; About that same time, John Cummings had taken into partnership a man
							named Stephen Clark.&nbsp; By the next year, Adam Good had taken Clark's place as junior
							partner at Ohio & Washington.&nbsp; This also did not last long, as Adam Good became a
							parter of John W. Davock, a lock maker and bell hanger, at the latter's shop at Washington &
							Swan streets, while John Cummings retained the property at Ohio & Washington as a
							blacksmith.&nbsp; By 1841, Cummings had relocated his blacksmith shop to Main street; it is
							not known how the property at Ohio & Washington was then being used.&nbsp; However, by 1842,
							the partnership of Davock & Good had broken up, and Adam Good was operating a brass foundry
							on that property; he remained there for almost two decades.&nbsp; By March of 1843, he had
							erected a furnace for the casting of large bells and heavy pieces for machinery (probably
							iron, not brass); he advertised this expanded capability under the name Lafayette Bell and
							Brass Foundry (see p.119 below).&nbsp; In 1849-50 he was spelling his last name as "Goode,"
							but thereafter he reverted to "Good."&nbsp; By 1858, Adam had diversified beyond bells &
							brass into the manufacture of steam engines, thus implying that he was capable of casting
							iron as well as brass and bronze.&nbsp; An 1859 article reported that his firm also had a
							division dedicated to the production of hose and belting (leather products).&nbsp; Another
							article that year reported that he had taken all of the premiums and prizes for Steam
							Engines at a recent Missouri Fair held in St.Louis.&nbsp; In 1861, it was reported that he
							had already shipped 24 steam engines of five to eight horsepower to Tidioute and Titusville
							in the Pennsylvania oil region, as well as setting up his own oil refinery in Buffalo in
							connection with the "extensive oil districts in the vicinity" of that city.&nbsp; Adam
							continued to own the Ohio Street property after he removed to Pennsylvania in 1864; it was
							apparently leased to the firm of Farrar, Trefts and Knight, who continued the
							engine-building operation but not the bellfounding operation, and used the Lafayette name as
							well.&nbsp; In Titusville, Adam Good set up another Lafayette Iron Works and Brass Foundry,
							which included a machine shop; he also constructed and leased office and hotel buildings,
							and set up a grist or flouring mill.&nbsp; It is not known whether he ever made any bells
							in Titusville.

						</dd>
						<dd>
							<b>Commentary:</b>&nbsp; While Benjamin Hanks' father (Uriah Hanks) came from near Duxbury,
							Massachusetts (there is no Duxbury in Connecticut), he was married in Mansfield,
							Connecticut, in 1755, and Benjamin was born there in 1757.&nbsp; All of Benjamin's siblings
							were also born in Mansfield, the last in 1782.&nbsp; Benjamin is reported to have lived and
							worked in Windham CT from 1777 to 1779, in Litchfield CT from 1779 to 1790, and then in
							Ashford CT briefly before returning to Mansfield.&nbsp; Windham and Ashford are not far
							from Mansfield, but Litchfield is on the other side of the state.&nbsp; Oddly, all nine of
							his children seem to have been born in Mansfield.&nbsp; While he might have cast some bells
							while in Litchfield, we have seen no evidence of that.&nbsp; Thus the years of operation of
							his foundry in Mansfield should be at most 1790-1808, and probably less.

							This is almost certainly an illustration of the 13-bell chime made for Christ Church,
							Cambridge, in 1860; possibly it was made from a photograph.&nbsp; It shows the chime set up
							in the yard of the foundry, surrounded by the workers and management.&nbsp; A narrow sign
							just above the topmost bells reads, "Cast by Henry N. Hooper & Co. Boston".&nbsp; Two things
							are especially notable about the chime as shown here.&nbsp; <br />

							Firstly, the chime-playing mechanism, located on the upper deck with four top-hatted
							gentlemen, is a taut-rope chiming rack.&nbsp; (That could be loosely described as an
							Ellacombe rack, though the construction is somewhat different.)&nbsp; Oddly, only 10 ropes
							are visible below the deck, and only 10 note names are shown on the top rail of the
							rack.&nbsp; <br />

							Secondly, eight bells are hung for swinging - possibly a diatonic octave on the tenor (which
							is in the independent frame at left).&nbsp; While this might seem to suggest, or to be
							inspired by, the idea of change-ringing (e.g., at Old North Church in Boston), these bells
							clearly have no stays, and thus could not safely be rung full-circle.

							to bear the name of C.T.Robinson & Co.&nbsp; This did not last long; though William S. Blake
							was apparently unemployed as of the time the 1889 directory was compiled, by the time of the
							1890 directory compilation Robinson was gone and William S. Blake was back running the
							foundry, this time under the name of Blake Bell Company.&nbsp; No additional evidence has

						<h2>(Appendix 3, added)</h2>
					</div>

					<p>
						The people listed below were principals in various foundries, but in most cases their last names
						were not the first part of the foundry name, so they cannot be easily located in the alphabetic
						list of foundries in Part II.&nbsp; A few were involved in multiple foundries, some of which are
						not obvious; these are marked "see also" or "etc." to indicate the non-obvious foundries with
						which they were associated.&nbsp; Also included are the last names of persons whose existence is
						implied by a partnership name, but whose full name is unknown.
