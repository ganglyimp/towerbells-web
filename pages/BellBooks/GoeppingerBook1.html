			<h2>Errata for the First Printing</h2>

			<p>
				<b>NOTE:</b> If you have not yet read the <A HREF="GoeppingerBook.html">announcement for this book</A>,
				please do so before continuing on this page.&nbsp; Otherwise, this will make little sense to you.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first printing of this book contained numerous typographic errors.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is no way 
				to distinguish between the two printings except by checking for the presence of these typos.
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					If your copy of the book does not contain the first typo listed below, then write "Second Printing" after 
					the publication date on the copyright page (back side of the title page).&nbsp; All of the errata which are 
					listed below were corrected in the second printing, so you can skip the rest of this page and go directly to 
					the <A HREF="GoeppingerBook2.html">Errata for the second printing, Commentary and Research Notes</A>.
				</li>
				<li>
					Otherwise, write "First printing" after the publication date on the copyright page (back side of the title 
					page).&nbsp; Then you should work through this list of errata, carefully and legibly posting the corrections 
					to your copy of the book.&nbsp; At the end of this list is a suggestion for what to do next.
