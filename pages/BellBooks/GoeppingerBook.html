					<p><b>From the Amazon and B&N Websites:</b></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Bells have played a significant role in US history and, in many cases are seen as national 
							symbols.&nbsp; This is especially true when it comes to the Liberty Bell, cast at a foundry 
							in England in 1752 and shipped to Philadelphia, where it was installed in the assembly house.
						</p>
						<p>
							Bells have also played a central role in this author's life.&nbsp; "I can still picture the 
							18-inch iron dinner bell that my mother used to call both myself and my brother to meals when 
							we were out playing on the family farm in Iowa.&nbsp; Indeed, my wife and I copied this 'PA' 
							system when we purchased our own large bell nearly 40 years ago.&nbsp; That was the start of a 
							life-long passion which has resulted in my collection of American large bells, and knowledge of 
							bells which I have been privileged to share with bell enthusiasts across the country."
						</p>
						<p>
							Large Bells of America provides a host of information not simply for enthusiasts and collectors, 
							but also for anyone who is interested in bells, and in the part that these American symbols have 
							played in United States history and our cultural, Christian and church heritage.
						</p>
						<p>
							This full-color book is divided into two parts.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the first part of the book the author looks at the early history of bells and their physical 
							characteristics including the components of a bell; the materials used to make bells, and the 
							different sound qualities that these materials produce; the various shapes produced; the difference 
							between swinging and stationery bells; how bells are tuned and much more.&nbsp; This part of the 
							book also looks at such things as how the truly big bells are created and how old bells can be 
							restored.
						</p>
						<p>
							The second part of the book provides a comprehensive directory of bell foundries, and includes 
							fascinating details of hundreds of foundries, including some very well-known names such as Andrew 
							Meneely, Pass &amp; Stow and Paul Revere, whose 1797 bell hangs in the People's Baptist Church of 
							Boston.&nbsp; Indeed, there are believed to be well over 100 church bells in existence bearing the 
							Revere inscription.
						</p>
						<p>
							Whether you are a bell enthusiast or collector, or simply have an interest in US history and the part 
							that large bells have played in the life of our nation, this book is a must read.

					<p><b>From the back cover of the book:</b></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Bells have figured in the culture and lives of Americans since the earliest days of our country.&nbsp; 
							As Historian of the American Bell Association, I appreciate that Neil Goeppinger has shared his lifetime 
							of research so that current and future generations will have all the essential facts about large bells and 
							foundries of America at their fingertips.&nbsp; If your interest is also in Americana and the sights and 
							sounds of days gone by, you will find much of interest in Large Bells of America: History of Church Bells, 
							Fire Bells, School Bells, Dinner Bells and Their Foundries.&nbsp; - Kathleen Collins, Historian, American 
							Bell Association.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is the most extensive book published on big bells.&nbsp; Neil has done exhaustive research over the years 
							and it shows in this book.&nbsp; The history is fascinating, along with the directory listings and the pictures.&nbsp; 
							This is a book you just cannot put down!&nbsp; - Bruce Clayton, CPA, bell appraiser
						</p>
						<p>
							Mr. Goeppinger has served as President of the American Bell Association, International, Inc. (ABAII).
						</p>
						<p>
							He continues to serve ABA as past-president and goodwill ambassador.&nbsp; You can find his articles and 
							comments on the <a href="http://www.americanbell.org/">American Bell Association website</a>.
							 - Gary Childress, bell enthusiast and purveyor
						</p>
					</blockquote>
		
					<p><b>From the Webmaster:</b></p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							This book is the result of Neil's many years of collecting and researching "big bells."&nbsp; Part II is a complete 
							list of every known or suspected bellfoundry in the history of America, with illustrations of the work of some of 
							them.&nbsp; (Some suspected bellfoundries may actually have been agents or retailers.)&nbsp; For each business in the 
							list, there is presented the location, year established, year closed, years of known operation, name of bellfounder, 
							predecessor &amp; successor, source of information, and other facts.&nbsp; An appendix lists all of the manufacturers 
							by state, thus providing a cross-index.&nbsp; This book is in a class by itself, because previous general-audience 
							books on bells that have mentioned bellfounders have not attempted to be comprehensive and have not documented their 
							sources of information.&nbsp; In spite of a few typographic errors, this is an essential addition to the library of 
							anyone who has an interest in tower bells or American industrial history.&nbsp; Highly recommended!&nbsp; Buy a copy 
							for your local public library!

					<h1 id="printing-versions">How to Distinguish Between the First and Second Printings</h1>
		
					<p>
						The first printing of this book contained numerous typographic errors.&nbsp; Most of them were corrected in the second 
						printing of the book.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is no way to distinguish between the two printings except by checking 
						for the presence of these typos.&nbsp; To do that, see the <A HREF="GoeppingerBook1.html">Errata for the first printing</A>.&nbsp;
						If your copy is from the first printing, then you should work through that list of errata, carefully and legibly posting 
						the corrections to your copy of the book.&nbsp; Regardless of which printing you have, you should then see the
						<A HREF="GoeppingerBook2.html">Errata for the second printing, Commentary and Research Notes</A>.&nbsp;
						Everything there is relevant to both printings.

					<p>
						I've known and respected Neil and his work for many years.&nbsp; For all that time, it has clearly been his intention 
						to publish a book about American bellfoundries.&nbsp; So when he let me make an extract from his database to support 
						my own researches, I honored his intention by keeping that extract confidential.
					</p>
					<p>
						Over the half century and more that I have been compiling information about carillons, and later including information 
						about chimes and then about tower bells in general, I have from time to time been urged to "write a book, Carl!"&nbsp;
						I resisted that urge because of the very obvious difficulty that such a book would be obsolete by the time it came off 
						the press.&nbsp; Publishing articles in the <I>GCNA Bulletin</I> from time to time was not a useful alternative, because 
						so much information changed so frequently.&nbsp; Thus I was very pleased when the Internet and the World Wide Web came along,
						as it offered a method of publication that could readily be updated as often as needed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now the time has come for Neil to publish his book, and it has been well worth the wait.&nbsp; So I am happy to join forces 
						with him by providing a means through which it can be kept up to date with the results of future researches by both of us.&nbsp;
						Watch for future additions!
