		<h1>Tower Bells - Introduction</h1>

		<section class="preamble">
			<p>
				For more than a thousand years, tower bells have spoken to the people with
				wordless voices.&nbsp; They have shouted in warning, wept in mourning and 
				laughed in rejoicing; they have told time and called to worship; they have 
				brought music to the populace.&nbsp; Although the ceaseless clamor of the 
				mass-transportation era has pushed these voices out of the daily lives of 
				the multitudes, they cannot be entirely silenced.&nbsp; Because they have 
				such power to stir the human soul, they still find a place in the modern 
				world, bringing old traditions with them and making new ones.
			</p>

			<p>
				This Website is dedicated to serving almost all aspects of tower bells by 
				informing the public about them.&nbsp; It does this in part by presenting 
				information arranged to support those organizations which follow specific 
				tower bell traditions.&nbsp; It also presents information related to tower 
				bell matters which are not directly related to any existing organization.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Do not expect to find completeness here.</b>&nbsp; This is an evolving 
				project, which uses links to other Websites to avoid duplication of 
				information.&nbsp; Nor will you find fancy Webpage formatting here--information 
				is what is important.&nbsp; (The system on which this Website was originally 
				hosted imposed severe file space limitations, but fortunately that is no 
				longer a constraint.)&nbsp; Also, because the author/editor/owner is a 
				North American, this Website is written in English, and it is most complete 
				with respect to the campanological customs and history of English-speaking 
				countries.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we do our best to provide information about 
				other countries, and are undoubtedly most successful for those countries 
				whose languages utilize the Latin alphabet, with or without the addition 
				of diacritical marks.&nbsp;

			<summary>Carillons</summary>

			<p>
				Carillons are musical instruments made of at least 23 conventional tower bells 
				which have been tuned so that they can be played together in harmony.&nbsp;
				The bells are hung fixed in a frame, or "dead", and are played by some kind of 
				mechanism which operates internal clappers and/or external hammers.&nbsp;
				There are two varieties:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Traditional carillons use a keyboard with baton-shaped manual keys, a pedal-board,
					and "tracker" action (direct mechanical connection) for precise dynamic control
					and dynamic musical expression.
				</li>
				<li>
					Non-traditional carillons use electro-mechanical or electro-pneumatic mechanisms,
					driven by an electric keyboard and/or various kinds of automatic controls.&nbsp;
					Most have no capability whatsoever for musical expression.&nbsp; Still, they 
					contain real bells, unlike the various electronic devices that attempt 
					(always unsuccessfully) to imitate bells.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
			Some traditional carillons are equipped with additional mechanisms of various kinds 
			for automatic play.&nbsp; A common motive for doing this is to strike the quarter-hours 
			and the hour as a clock-chime would do.&nbsp; (See below.)
			</p>

			<p>
				The data side of this Website lists and describes all known carillons 
				<a href="data/NA_car_ixs.html">in North America</a> and
				<a href="data/Data_Top.html">elsewhere in the world</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				See <a href="http://www.gcna.org/">The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America</a> 
				(GCNA) for a more formal definition of "carillon" and for information about the 
				Guild's activities and related events.&nbsp; The Guild's focus is on what is here 
				called the "traditional" carillon, there called simply a carillon. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The GCNA is one of the member societies of the
				<a href="http://www.carillon.org/">World Carillon Federation</a>,
				an association of all national and regional societies which focus their interest on
				the art of the carillon -- its music, its playing, its manufacture and its history.

		<details class="intro-section" id="Chimes">
			<summary>Chimes</summary>

			<p>
				Chimes are smaller musical instruments (8 to 22 conventional tower bells, hung 
				fixed) in which the bells may or may not have been tuned, but nevertheless 
				approximate the diatonic or chromatic scales sufficiently well to be able to 
				play tunes recognizably.&nbsp; Some are in fact tuned to the same precision as 
				carillons, and thus can be used to play harmony as well as melody.&nbsp; Several 
				different kinds of mechanisms have been used to play chimes, either manually or 
				automatically, but in comparison to carillons there is less need to distinguish 
				between traditional and non-traditional mechanisms (though we do make that 
				distinction when possible).&nbsp; An additional function as a clock-chime (see below) 
				is fairly common.&nbsp; Among older chimes in churches, the inclusion of one or 
				more swinging bells is also fairly common.
			</p>

			<p>
				The data side of this Website lists and describes almost all known chimes both
				<a href="data/NA_chi_ixs.html">in North America</a> and
				<a href="data/Data_Top.html">elsewhere in the world</a>.&nbsp;
				Most in the United Kingdom are omitted, but a link is provided whereby you can find them.
			</p>

			<p>
				The only known formal organizations for chimers are those which are centered on the 
				various regional bell-ringing traditions in Italy.&nbsp; Those organizations are 
				members of the Federazione Nazionale Suonatori di Campane 
				(<a href="http://www.fnsc.it/index.html">FNSC</a>).&nbsp; Elsewhere, chimers whose 
				interests extend beyond their own towers are usually welcomed as members of one of 
				the national or regional societies that make up the
				<a href="http://www.carillon.org/">World Carillon Federation</a>.

		<details class="intro-section" id="Rings">
			<summary>Rings; change-ringing</summary>

			<p>
				Rings are chime-sized sets of tower bells (commonly 5 to 12 in number) tuned to 
				the diatonic scale and hung to swing in a full circle, with each bell controlled 
				by one member of a team of ringers by means of a single rope and wheel.&nbsp;
				Most rings are hung and rung in the English style called "change ringing".&nbsp;
				However, in the Veronese district of Italy are many rings hung for what may be 
				called "concerto" ringing.
			</p>

			<p>
				The data side of this Website lists and describes all known rings 
				<a href="data/NA_ring_ixs.html">in North America</a> and
				<a href="data/Data_Top.html">elsewhere in the world outside the United Kingdom</a>.&nbsp;
				For rings in the UK, see the online
				<a href="http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/">Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers</a>.&nbsp; 
			</p>

			<p>
				See the Website of
				<A HREF="http://www.nagcr.org/">The North American Guild of Change Ringers</A> (NAGCR)
				for information about change ringing on this continent.&nbsp; There you will also find 
				links to numerous other Websites focused on the special techniques of hanging tower 
				bells and ringing them in various mathematically-based methods.&nbsp; Some of those 
				links will take you to England, the place of origin of change-ringing and home of more 
				than 95% of the world's "ringable" towers.&nbsp; Another place to look is 
				<a href="http://www.ringing.info">www.ringing.info</a>, the most extensive collection of 
				ringing-related references to be found anywhere.
			</p>

			<p>
				A page on <a href="MusicalScales.html">Musical Scales in Ringing</a> explains note names
				in major keys as they relate to the customary arrangement of notes for change ringing.

		<details class="intro-section" id="Peals">
			<summary>Peals, clock-chimes, zvons, single bells, etc.</summary>

			<p>
				Single tower bells and small sets of such bells are (or have been) used 
				for a wide variety of purposes, some of which are described here.
			</p>

			<h2>Peals</h2>
			<p>
				A peal is a set of two or more bells hung for swinging in less than a full circle.&nbsp;
				Consequently, each bell swings at its own natural pendulum frequency, so that it
				appears to sound randomly with respect to the other bell(s) in the peal.&nbsp;
				In Canada and the USA, some churches have peals of two to five bells; in churches of 
				continental Europe and Spanish-speaking countries, cathedrals and very large churches may 
				have peals of more than a dozen bells.&nbsp; There is no prescribed relationship among 
				the pitches of peal bells, though in the case of three or four they are often arranged in 
				a major or minor chord.&nbsp; Customary usages of peals, as well as methods of hanging 
				them, are quite variable.&nbsp; Peals of 8 or more bells are indexed and described along 
				with chimes (see above); smaller peals are not listed here.
			</p>

			<h2>Clock-chimes</h2>
			<p>
				A clock-chime is a set of two to eight bells (most commonly two, three or four) hung dead 
				to be struck under control of a tower clock, usually to indicate the quarter hours in 
				addition to the hour.&nbsp; The most famous arrangement of bells for this purpose is the 
				four notes of the Westminster Quarters, more properly called Cambridge quarters.&nbsp;
				Another common arrangement is "ting-tang" quarters, which requires only two bells.&nbsp;
				A variety of other arrangements are known, some being unique to a particular clock.
			</p>

			<h2>Zvons</h2>
			<p>
				A zvon is a set of bells hung dead and rung in rhythmic patterns according to the
				liturgical principles of the Russian Orthodox Church (or, less commonly, another of
				the national Orthodox Christian churches).&nbsp; The pitches of the bells in a zvon 
				are not arranged scale-wise, though some of them may fit familiar chords.&nbsp;
				The heaviest bells ever hung in towers are the basses of Russian zvons.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also falling into this category are the stationary peals of Malta and some other places.&nbsp;
				Although they are hung dead like zvons, and are likely to be tuned to a chord of the major scale, 
				they are rung in patterns that sound more like the natural pendulum frequencies of peals.
			</p>

			<h2>Single bells</h2>
			<p>
				Some of the most common uses for single bells are as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>
						A <b>church bell</b> calls members of a congregation to worship, and is usually 
						swung for that purpose.&nbsp; In olden days it was always swung by hand;
						nowadays it may instead be swung by an electric motor.&nbsp; Sometimes it can 
						also be tolled for funerals, using a separate hammer.
					</li>
					<li>
						A <b>clock bell</b> is hung dead to be struck under control of a tower clock
						to indicate the hours of the day.&nbsp; Some tower clocks also strike once at 
						the half hour, either on the hour bell or on a smaller bell; more complex tower 
						clocks operate clock-chimes (see above).
					</li>
					<li>
						A <b>fire bell</b> or <b>alarm bell</b> was usually hung dead, and was struck
						in distinctive patterns to warn the community of fire or other danger.&nbsp;
						This usage has become obsolete since the development of electrically-operated 
						sirens.&nbsp; But some fire bells survive as historical artifacts, occasionally 
						in their original locations.
					</li>
					<li>
						A <b>fog bell</b> or <b>lighthouse bell</b> was often used to warn ships of
						coastal hazards when fog obscured the light from the lighthouse.&nbsp;
						This function was superseded by foghorns of various types, which in turn became 
						obsolete as well.&nbsp; Some fog bells survive as historical artifacts, 
						occasionally in their original locations.
					</li>
					<li>
						A <b>plantation bell</b> was a small tower bell used for signalling on a
						plantation, farm or estate.&nbsp; The smallest of these, mounted in a fork 
						atop a post, was commonly called a <b>farm bell</b> or <b>dinner bell</b>.
					</li>
					<li>
						A <b>factory bell</b> was a tower bell used for signalling a shift change
						or other event in a manufacturing plant.
					</li>
					<li>
						A <b>bridge bell</b> was a very small tower bell used for warning street traffic 
						that a drawbridge or turnbridge over a river or canal was about to open.
					</li>
					<li>
						A tower bell of appropriate size could be used as a <B>ship's bell</B> on a
						riverboat or warship.&nbsp; For this purpose it could be hung from a mast or 
						mounted on an upper deck with conventional fittings.&nbsp; It was used to 
						signal the deck crew (and wharf crew) from the pilot house, and was distinct 
						from the small bells used to signal the engine room or to indicate time.
					</li>

		<details class="intro-section" id="Tubular-Bells">
			<summary>Tubular tower bells</summary>

			<p>
				Large tubular bells, cast or extruded from approximately the same material as 
				conventional tower bells (or perhaps of brass rather than bronze), have been 
				used to make tower music or to serve as clock bells.&nbsp; The largest such tubes 
				weigh hundreds of pounds.&nbsp; Chimes made of these bells appeared in both England 
				and the USA in the late 19th century.&nbsp; About 180 were made in England, though 
				not much is yet known about them; a few were exported to Canada and other places 
				in the British empire.&nbsp; The early American tubular chimes never became 
				popular--only a couple of dozen are known, and little is known about their makers.&nbsp;
				But a later American maker produced more than 440 tubular tower chimes of various sizes.

		<details class="intro-section" id="Hemispherical-Bells">
			<summary>Hemispherical tower bells</summary>
			<p>
				Large hemispherical bells were made for tower use in both England and the USA in the 
				late 19th and early 20th centuries.&nbsp; Like tubular bells, they were intended to be 
				an economical substitute for conventional tower bells.&nbsp; About 40 chimes of such 
				bells are known to have been made in England, though many no longer survive.&nbsp;
				Only about five such chimes were made in the USA, while two were imported from England.&nbsp;
				All are listed on the <A HREF="data/IXNASMchimola.html">chimola index page</A>.

		<details class="intro-section" id="Other-Bells">
			<summary>Other bells</summary>

			<p>
				There are some kinds of bells which, while not primarily intended for use as
				tower bells, have nevertheless been used that way on occasion.&nbsp;
				They include railroad bells (brass or bronze) and postmount farm or dinner bells 
				(cast steel).&nbsp; Some information about such bells may eventually be included here.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are many kinds of bells which are not tower bells.&nbsp; A few examples are 
				handbells, doorbells, cowbells, sleigh bells, gongs, thin-wall tubular bells (for 
				orchestra, pipe organ, or long-case clock) and many varieties of collectible small 
				bells.&nbsp; We do not presently intend to cover any of these kinds of bells, though 
				we will provide links to other sites which do so.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are also things in towers which purport to be bells, chimes or carillons, but are 
				not.&nbsp; All of these things involve large outdoor loudspeakers plus electronic devices 
				which either play recordings of real bells or attempt (always unsuccessfully) to generate 
				sounds which imitate real bells.&nbsp; We will never cover any of these kinds of devices, 
				nor will we provide links to other sites which do so.&nbsp; (Exception: For other sites 
				related to both real bells and electronic imitations, we may provide links with respect to 
				the real bell topics.)
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Oriental temple bells:</b>&nbsp;
				In China, Japan, Korea, and many of the countries of Southeast Asia, bells of different kinds
				are often associated with worship practices in the temples of indigenous religions.&nbsp;
				Some of these temple bells are cast from bronze as Western bells are, and the largest of them 
				are among the very largest bells in the world.&nbsp; However, their shape and sound are 
				significantly different from that of Western bells, as is their use.&nbsp; They are hung 
				stationary, usually near ground level, and are rung singly.&nbsp; The largest of these are 
				listed here on a page about <a href="data/APGreatBellsO.html">great Oriental bells</a>.

				(HMA was formerly The American Guild of English Handbell Ringers, or AGEHR.)
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Collectibles:</b>
				The principal organization of bell collectors is
				<a href="https://www.americanbell.org">The American Bell Association International, Inc.</a> 
				(ABAII).&nbsp; However, one need not be a collector to join ABAII.&nbsp; Their bi-monthly 
				magazine, <U>The Bell Tower</U>, often contains articles about other types of bells, including 
				tower bells.

		<details class="intro-section" id="Bellfounders">
			<summary>Bellfounders and bell making</summary>
			<p>
				Tower bells are typically made in foundries which are essentially dedicated to this function,
				since there is no longer a market for other cast bronze objects of comparable size.&nbsp;
				(In bygone centuries, those who made bells in peacetime made cannon in wartime--a variation
				on the ancient concept of "beating swords into plowshares".&nbsp; But bronze cannon became 
				obsolete, while bronze bells didn't, or at least not to the same degree.)

				Here we add to that an <A HREF="../Cwt-Qtr-Lb_Calculator.html">online calculator</A>
