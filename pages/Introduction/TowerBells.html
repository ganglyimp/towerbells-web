			<h1>Tower Bells - Introduction</h1>
			<p>
				For more than a thousand years, tower bells have spoken to the people with wordless voices.&nbsp; They
				have shouted in warning, wept in mourning and laughed in rejoicing; they have told time and called to
				worship; they have brought music to the populace.&nbsp; Although the ceaseless clamor of the
				mass-transportation era has pushed these voices out of the daily lives of the multitudes, they cannot be
				entirely silenced.&nbsp; Because they have such power to stir the human soul, they still find a place in
				the modern world, bringing old traditions with them and making new ones.
			</p>

			<p>
				This Website is dedicated to serving almost all aspects of tower bells by informing the public about
				them.&nbsp; It does this in part by presenting information arranged to support those organizations which
				follow specific tower bell traditions.&nbsp; It also presents information related to tower bell matters
				which are not directly related to any existing organization.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Do not expect to find completeness here.</b>&nbsp; This is an evolving project, which uses links to
				other Websites to avoid duplication of information.&nbsp; Nor will you find fancy Webpage formatting
				here--information is what is important.&nbsp; (The system on which this Website was originally hosted
				imposed severe file space limitations, but fortunately that is no longer a constraint.)&nbsp; Also,
				because the author/editor/owner is a North American, this Website is written in English, and it is most
				complete with respect to the campanological customs and history of English-speaking countries.&nbsp;
				Nevertheless, we do our best to provide information about other countries, and are undoubtedly most
				successful for those countries whose languages utilize the Latin alphabet, with or without the addition
				of diacritical marks.&nbsp; See also our page about
				<a href="/towerbells-web/pages/VocabularyErrs.html">vocabulary oddities and errors</a>.

		<section class="intro-section" id="Carillons">
			<h1>Carillons</h1>

			<p>
				Carillons are musical instruments made of at least 23 conventional tower bells which have been tuned so
				that they can be played together in harmony.&nbsp; The bells are hung fixed in a frame, or "dead", and
				are played by some kind of mechanism which operates internal clappers and/or external hammers.&nbsp;
				There are two varieties:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Traditional carillons use a keyboard with baton-shaped manual keys, a pedal-board, and "tracker"
					action (direct mechanical connection) for precise dynamic control and dynamic musical expression.
				</li>
				<li>
					Non-traditional carillons use electro-mechanical or electro-pneumatic mechanisms, driven by an
					electric keyboard and/or various kinds of automatic controls.&nbsp; Most have no capability
					whatsoever for musical expression.&nbsp; Still, they contain real bells, unlike the various
					electronic devices that attempt (always unsuccessfully) to imitate bells.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Some traditional carillons are equipped with additional mechanisms of various kinds for automatic
				play.&nbsp; A common motive for doing this is to strike the quarter-hours and the hour as a clock-chime
				would do.&nbsp; (See below.)
			</p>

			<p>
				The data side of this Website lists and describes all known carillons
				<a href="/towerbells-web/data/NA_car_ixs.html">in North America</a> and
				<a href="/towerbells-web/data/Data_Top.html">elsewhere in the world</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				See <a href="http://www.gcna.org/">The Guild of Carillonneurs in North America</a> (GCNA) for a more
				formal definition of "carillon" and for information about the Guild's activities and related
				events.&nbsp; The Guild's focus is on what is here called the "traditional" carillon, there called
				simply a carillon.
			</p>

			<p>
				The GCNA is one of the member societies of the
				<a href="http://www.carillon.org/">World Carillon Federation</a>, an association of all national and
				regional societies which focus their interest on the art of the carillon -- its music, its playing, its
				manufacture and its history.
			</p>

				Filling out the <a href="/towerbells-web/data/SurveyForms.html">survey forms</a> for your carillon and its tower will
				get you a free extract from the database "Carillons and Chimes of the World."
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="intro-section" id="Chimes">
			<h1>Chimes</h1>

			<p>
				Chimes are smaller musical instruments (8 to 22 conventional tower bells, hung fixed) in which the bells
				may or may not have been tuned, but nevertheless approximate the diatonic or chromatic scales
				sufficiently well to be able to play tunes recognizably.&nbsp; Some are in fact tuned to the same
				precision as carillons, and thus can be used to play harmony as well as melody.&nbsp; Several
				different kinds of mechanisms have been used to play chimes, either manually or automatically, but in
				comparison to carillons there is less need to distinguish between traditional and non-traditional
				mechanisms (though we do make that distinction when possible).&nbsp; An additional function as a
				clock-chime (see below) is fairly common.&nbsp; Among older chimes in churches, the inclusion of one or
				more swinging bells is also fairly common.
			</p>

			<p>
				The data side of this Website lists and describes almost all known chimes both
				<a href="/towerbells-web/data/NA_chi_ixs.html">in North America</a> and
				<a href="/towerbells-web/data/Data_Top.html">elsewhere in the world</a>.&nbsp;
				Most in the United Kingdom are omitted, but a link is provided whereby you can find them.
			</p>

			<p>
				The only known formal organizations for chimers are those which are centered on the various regional
				bell-ringing traditions in Italy.&nbsp; Those organizations are members of the Federazione Nazionale
				Suonatori di Campane (<a href="http://www.fnsc.it/index.html">FNSC</a>).&nbsp; Elsewhere, chimers whose
				interests extend beyond their own towers are usually welcomed as members of one of the national or
				regional societies that make up the <a href="http://www.carillon.org/">World Carillon Federation</a>.

		<section class="intro-section" id="Rings">
			<h1>Rings; Change-Ringing</h1>

			<p>
				Rings are chime-sized sets of tower bells (commonly 5 to 12 in number) tuned to the diatonic scale and
				hung to swing in a full circle, with each bell controlled by one member of a team of ringers by means of
				a single rope and wheel.&nbsp; Most rings are hung and rung in the English style called "change
				ringing".&nbsp; However, in the Veronese district of Italy are many rings hung for what may be
				called "concerto" ringing.
			</p>

			<p>
				The data side of this Website lists and describes all known rings
				<a href="/towerbells-web/data/NA_ring_ixs.html">in North America</a> and
				<a href="/towerbells-web/data/Data_Top.html">elsewhere in the world outside the United Kingdom</a>.&nbsp;
				For rings in the UK, see the online
				<a href="http://dove.cccbr.org.uk/">Dove's Guide for Church Bell Ringers</a>.&nbsp;
			</p>

			<p>
				See the Website of
				<a href="http://www.nagcr.org/">The North American Guild of Change Ringers</A> (NAGCR)
				for information about change ringing on this continent.&nbsp; There you will also find links to numerous
				other Websites focused on the special techniques of hanging tower bells and ringing them in various
				mathematically-based methods.&nbsp; Some of those links will take you to England, the place of origin of
				change-ringing and home of more than 95% of the world's "ringable" towers.&nbsp; Another place to look
				is <a href="http://www.ringing.info">www.ringing.info</a>, the most extensive collection of
				ringing-related references to be found anywhere.
			</p>

			<p>
				A page on <a href="/towerbells-web/pages/Introduction/MusicalScales.html">Musical Scales in Ringing</a> explains note
				names in major keys as they relate to the customary arrangement of notes for change ringing.

		<section class="intro-section" id="Peals">
			<h1>Peals, Clock-Chimes, Zvons, Single Bells, Etc.</h1>

			<p>
				Single tower bells and small sets of such bells are (or have been) used for a wide variety of purposes,
				some of which are described here.
			</p>

			<h2>Peals</h2>
			<p>
				A peal is a set of two or more bells hung for swinging in less than a full circle.&nbsp; Consequently,
				each bell swings at its own natural pendulum frequency, so that it appears to sound randomly with
				respect to the other bell(s) in the peal.&nbsp; In Canada and the USA, some churches have peals of two
				to five bells; in churches of continental Europe and Spanish-speaking countries, cathedrals and very
				large churches may have peals of more than a dozen bells.&nbsp; There is no prescribed relationship
				among the pitches of peal bells, though in the case of three or four they are often arranged in
				a major or minor chord.&nbsp; Customary usages of peals, as well as methods of hanging them, are quite
				variable.&nbsp; Peals of 8 or more bells are indexed and described along with chimes (see above);
				smaller peals are not listed here.
			</p>

			<h2>Clock-chimes</h2>
			<p>
				A clock-chime is a set of two to eight bells (most commonly two, three or four) hung dead to be struck
				under control of a tower clock, usually to indicate the quarter hours in addition to the hour.&nbsp; The
				most famous arrangement of bells for this purpose is the four notes of the Westminster Quarters, more
				properly called Cambridge quarters.&nbsp; Another common arrangement is "ting-tang" quarters, which
				requires only two bells.&nbsp; A variety of other arrangements are known, some being unique to a
				particular clock.
			</p>

			<h2>Zvons</h2>
			<p>
				A zvon is a set of bells hung dead and rung in rhythmic patterns according to the liturgical principles
				of the Russian Orthodox Church (or, less commonly, another of the national Orthodox Christian
				churches).&nbsp; The pitches of the bells in a zvon are not arranged scale-wise, though some of them may
				fit familiar chords.&nbsp; The heaviest bells ever hung in towers are the basses of Russian zvons.
			</p>
			<p>
				Also falling into this category are the stationary peals of Malta and some other places.&nbsp; Although
				they are hung dead like zvons, and are likely to be tuned to a chord of the major scale, they are rung
				in patterns that sound more like the natural pendulum frequencies of peals.
			</p>

			<h2>Single bells</h2>
			<p>
				Some of the most common uses for single bells are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>
					A <b>church bell</b> calls members of a congregation to worship, and is usually swung for that
					purpose.&nbsp; In olden days it was always swung by hand; nowadays it may instead be swung by an
					electric motor.&nbsp; Sometimes it can also be tolled for funerals, using a separate hammer.
				</li>
				<li>
					A <b>clock bell</b> is hung dead to be struck under control of a tower clock to indicate the hours
					of the day.&nbsp; Some tower clocks also strike once at the half hour, either on the hour bell or on
					a smaller bell; more complex tower clocks operate clock-chimes (see above).
				</li>
				<li>
					A <b>fire bell</b> or <b>alarm bell</b> was usually hung dead, and was struck in distinctive
					patterns to warn the community of fire or other danger.&nbsp; This usage has become obsolete since
					the development of electrically-operated sirens.&nbsp; But some fire bells survive as historical
					artifacts, occasionally in their original locations.
				</li>
				<li>
					A <b>fog bell</b> or <b>lighthouse bell</b> was often used to warn ships of coastal hazards when fog
					obscured the light from the lighthouse.&nbsp; This function was superseded by foghorns of various
					types, which in turn became obsolete as well.&nbsp; Some fog bells survive as historical artifacts,
					occasionally in their original locations.
				</li>
				<li>
					A <b>plantation bell</b> was a small tower bell used for signalling on a plantation, farm or
					estate.&nbsp; The smallest of these, mounted in a fork atop a post, was commonly called a
					<b>farm bell</b> or <b>dinner bell</b>.
				</li>
				<li>
					A <b>factory bell</b> was a tower bell used for signalling a shift change or other event in a
					manufacturing plant.
				</li>
				<li>
					A <b>bridge bell</b> was a very small tower bell used for warning street traffic that a drawbridge
					or turnbridge over a river or canal was about to open.
				</li>
				<li>
					A tower bell of appropriate size could be used as a <B>ship's bell</B> on a riverboat or
					warship.&nbsp; For this purpose it could be hung from a mast or mounted on an upper deck with
					conventional fittings.&nbsp; It was used to signal the deck crew (and wharf crew) from the pilot
					house, and was distinct from the small bells used to signal the engine room or to indicate time.
				</li>

		<section class="intro-section" id="Great-Bells">
			<h1>Great Bells</h1>

			<p>
				These are <i>REALLY BIG</i> bells, which impress viewers by their sheer size and listeners by the
				profundity (both in depth and in volume) of their sound.&nbsp; For more details, including our
				definition plus lists of such bells around the world, see our
				<a href="/towerbells-web/data/Great_Bells.html">Great Bells page</a>.&nbsp; Some regional lists are believed to be
				complete, while others are known to be incomplete.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="intro-section" id="Tubular-Bells">
			<h1>Tubular Tower Bells</h1>

			<p>
				Large tubular bells, cast or extruded from approximately the same material as conventional tower bells
				(or perhaps of brass rather than bronze), have been used to make tower music or to serve as clock
				bells.&nbsp; The largest such tubes weigh hundreds of pounds.&nbsp; Chimes made of these bells appeared
				in both England and the USA in the late 19th century.&nbsp; About 180 were made in England, though
				not much is yet known about them; a few were exported to Canada and other places in the British
				empire.&nbsp; The early American tubular chimes never became popular--only a couple of dozen are known,
				and little is known about their makers.&nbsp; But a later American maker produced more than 440 tubular
				tower chimes of various sizes.
			</p>

		<section class="intro-section" id="Hemispherical-Bells">
			<h1>Hemispherical Tower Bells</h1>
			<p>
				Large hemispherical bells were made for tower use in both England and the USA in the late 19th and early
				20th centuries.&nbsp; Like tubular bells, they were intended to be an economical substitute for
				conventional tower bells.&nbsp; About 40 chimes of such bells are known to have been made in England,
				though many no longer survive.&nbsp; Only about five such chimes were made in the USA, while two were
				imported from England.&nbsp; All are listed on the
				<a href="/towerbells-web/data/IXNASMchimola.html">chimola index page</a>.

		</section>

		<section class="intro-section" id="Other-Bells">
			<h1>Other Bells</h1>

			<p>
				There are some kinds of bells which, while not primarily intended for use as tower bells, have
				nevertheless been used that way on occasion.&nbsp; They include railroad bells (brass or bronze) and
				postmount farm or dinner bells (cast steel).&nbsp; Some information about such bells may eventually be
				included here.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are many kinds of bells which are not tower bells.&nbsp; A few examples are handbells, doorbells,
				cowbells, sleigh bells, gongs, thin-wall tubular bells (for orchestra, pipe organ, or long-case clock)
				and many varieties of collectible small bells.&nbsp; We do not presently intend to cover any of these
				kinds of bells, though we will provide links to other sites which do so.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are also things in towers which purport to be bells, chimes or carillons, but are not.&nbsp; All
				of these things involve large outdoor loudspeakers plus electronic devices which either play recordings
				of real bells or attempt (always unsuccessfully) to generate sounds which imitate real bells.&nbsp; We
				will never cover any of these kinds of devices, nor will we provide links to other sites which do
				so.&nbsp; (Exception: For other sites related to both real bells and electronic imitations, we may
				provide links with respect to the real bell topics.)
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Oriental temple bells:</b>&nbsp;
				In China, Japan, Korea, and many of the countries of Southeast Asia, bells of different kinds are often
				associated with worship practices in the temples of indigenous religions.&nbsp; Some of these temple
				bells are cast from bronze as Western bells are, and the largest of them are among the very largest
				bells in the world.&nbsp; However, their shape and sound are significantly different from that of
				Western bells, as is their use.&nbsp; They are hung stationary, usually near ground level, and are rung
				singly.&nbsp; The largest of these are listed here on a page about
				<a href="/towerbells-web/data/APGreatBellsO.html">great Oriental bells</a>.

			<p>
				<b>Handbells:</b>&nbsp;
				See the Website of the <a href="http://www.hma.org/">Handbell Musicians of America</a> (HMA) for
				information about making music with handbells, and for links to related resources.&nbsp; (HMA was
				formerly The American Guild of English Handbell Ringers, or AGEHR.)
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Collectibles:</b>
				The principal organization of bell collectors is
				<a href="https://www.americanbell.org">The American Bell Association International, Inc.</a>
				(ABAII).&nbsp; However, one need not be a collector to join ABAII.&nbsp; Their bi-monthly magazine,
				<u>The Bell Tower</u>, often contains articles about other types of bells, including tower bells.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section class="intro-section" id="Bellfounders">
			<h1>Bellfounders and Bell Making</h1>
			<p>
				Tower bells are typically made in foundries which are essentially dedicated to this function, since
				there is no longer a market for other cast bronze objects of comparable size.&nbsp; (In bygone
				centuries, those who made bells in peacetime made cannon in wartime--a variation on the ancient concept
				of "beating swords into plowshares".&nbsp; But bronze cannon became obsolete, while bronze bells didn't,
				or at least not to the same degree.)

		<section class="intro-section" id="Bell-Weights">
			<h1>Weights of Bells</h1>

			<p>
				The weights of bells can be reported in any of several different units of measure, some common and some
				obscure.&nbsp; The subject is discussed at length here, <!-- ex-GCNA -->
				beginning at a <a href="/towerbells-web/data/Weights.html">page about bell weights</a>.&nbsp; Here we add to that an
				<a href="/towerbells-web/pages/BellWeightCalculator.html">online calculator</a> for converting between different units
				of measurement of weight.&nbsp; This is especially designed to handle the old British Imperial system of
				Cwt-Qtr-Lb, which is still in regular use to describe bells hung for change-ringing.&nbsp;
