            <h1>Boston Bellfoundry Data</h1>

            <p>
                This page presents selected raw data from various issues of the city directory for Boston, Massachusetts, 
                USA.&nbsp; These data items were selected for their actual or probable relevance to the bellfounding 
                industry.&nbsp; Some of the data items were expected, because they relate to the personnel of two major 
                bellfoundries which are known to have operated in this city.&nbsp; Some of the items were unexpected, 
                and probably relate to firms which were dealers rather than bellfounders.&nbsp; Certainly that is the case 
                for a number of items which are evidence for the presence of an office of a well-known English manufacturer 
                of steel bells.&nbsp; Excluded from this selection are bell-hangers, whose business was the installation
                and maintenance of mechanical doorbells and servant call bells.
            </p>
            <p>
                A description of the raw data is given on this page (below); the interpretation of that data is found on 
                separate pages about the three major firms:&nbsp; the <A HREF="../BellFoundries/RevereFoundry.html">Revere 
                bellfoundry</A>, the <A HREF="data/IXfoundryHooperBlake.html">Hooper/Blake bellfoundry</A> and the 
                <A HREF="../BellFoundries/NVinNA.html">Naylor-Vickers office</A>.&nbsp; (See also the compiler's notes 
                below.)&nbsp; Also included are a few items about other bell-related businesses; these have not yet been 
                utilized elsewhere.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                The Boston city directories are similar to those from other major American cities of the 19th century.&nbsp;
                The bulk of the material is an alphabetic listing (by last name) of all citizens who conducted, or were 
                employed in, commercial, political or charitable operations of all kinds, or who were heads of households.&nbsp;
                This listing includes the names of commercial partnerships or enterprises.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prefacing the alphabetic section is various descriptive material about the city.&nbsp; In some directories, 
                the alphabetic section is followed by a Business Directory, which is a classified listing of various enterprises; 
                this may be a brief summary or an exhaustive list.&nbsp; Typically there will be some amount of advertising material, 
                usually done with a wide variety of fancy typefaces and sometimes including engraved images as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Tufts Digital Library (TDL), the alphabetic listing by name has been processed through Optical Character 
                Recognition (OCR) so that it is fully searchable by word or phrase.&nbsp; Furthermore, it is indexed and paginated 
                so that all entries with the same last name can be seen on a single page.&nbsp; Other material has only been scanned 
                as graphical page images, so it is not searchable; small typefaces are often not entirely readable.&nbsp; (The online 
                directories for some years do not contain this material, or contain only parts of it.)&nbsp; Unfortunately, this material 
                has been partially or completely omitted for some years of the directories; where present, it is often poorly indexed.&nbsp;
                Nevertheless, it is occasionally useful.
            </p>
            <p>
                All relevant data from the alphabetic section of each available year is recorded here exactly as found in the 
                source except for four minor editorial changes:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Where words are obviously run together, a space has been inserted for readability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Long lines have been re-wrapped for readability.&nbsp; (The OCR processing by TDL did not preserve 
                    original line wraps.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    A few comments have been inserted in [square brackets].&nbsp; Some emphasize the absence of data for a 
                    particular name that is present for other years; others reflect the separate capture of various graphical 
                    images.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For most years, the alphabetic entries have been grouped according to the particular business to which 
                    they are relevant.&nbsp; Within each such group, the original alphabetic order is retained.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Any relevant data found in the graphic page images has been captured for reference by the compiler of this 
                page (and mention is made of that fact), but for the most part it is not presented here.&nbsp; In a few 
                instances, information from those images has been transcribed here.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mark [?] indicates that a transcription is questionable, either because the compiler of this page found a 
                graphic image not entirely readable, or because there appears to be an error in the digitization of the 
                directory, or because there is suspicion of a typographical error in the original directory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Common abbreviations found in the data:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>bds. = boards &nbsp; [rents a room, usually with morning and evening meals included]</li>
                <li>h. = house &nbsp; [probably implying ownership of a single-family residence]</li>
                <li>& Co. = and Company &nbsp; [implying that there are other investors in this commercial venture]</li>
                <li>st. = street &nbsp; [also implied after all other street names]</li>
                <li>pl. = place &nbsp; [rather than "street"]</li>
                <li>c. = corner &nbsp; [of two streets]</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Compiler's Notes</h2>
            <p>
                Reading old city directories, whether in paper or online, is rather like reading last year's telephone 
                directory for fun.&nbsp; To the onlooker, it seems to be unimaginably tedious drudgery.&nbsp; But to the 
                compiler of data, it's like a treasure hunt - following clues based on what is already known, one suddenly 
                finds unexpected gems of new information.&nbsp; This page, for example, sprang from a search for supporting 
                data regarding the Hooper/Blake bellfoundry, the history of which is only partially known.&nbsp; Finding 
                evidence for a Boston office representing the English manufactory of Naylor-Vickers was an unexpected bonus, 
                as it helps to explain the rather surprising number of Naylor-Vickers steel bells which are to be found in the 
                New England area, and indeed elsewhere in the USA.
            </p>
            <p>
                The inclusion of the data for Foster & Roby is based entirely on their appearance in the classification 
                "Bells" in the 1872 directory.&nbsp; No bells bearing that name are known to American bell historians.&nbsp;
                Since this firm was variously listed as brassfounders and as metal dealers, it is conceivable that they made 
                small bells for the use of bell hangers (i.e., servant call bells, etc.) and/or that they acted as agents for 
                western bellfoundries.

                One hopes that the TDL will complete the planned work to put the 1860 city directory online, along with others 
                that would fill in some of the gaps in the data presented above.
