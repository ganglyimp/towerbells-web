<h1>Boston bellfoundry data</h1>
<p>
This page presents selected raw data from various issues of the city directory
for Boston, Massachusetts, USA.&nbsp;
These data items were selected for their actual or probable relevance to the bellfounding industry.&nbsp;
Some of the data items were expected, because they relate to the personnel of two major bellfoundries which are known to have operated in this city.&nbsp;
Some of the items were unexpected, 
and probably relate to firms which were dealers rather than bellfounders.&nbsp;
Certainly that is the case for a number of items which are evidence for the presence of
an office of a well-known English manufacturer of steel bells.&nbsp;
Excluded from this selection are bell-hangers, whose business was the installation
and maintenance of mechanical doorbells and servant call bells.
<p>
A description of the raw data is given on this page (below); 
the interpretation of that data is found on separate pages about the three major firms:&nbsp;
the <A HREF="../BellFOundaries/RevereFoundry.html">Revere bellfoundry</A>,
the <A HREF="data/IXfoundryHooperBlake.html">Hooper/Blake bellfoundry</A>
and the <A HREF="../BellFOundaries/NVinNA.html">Naylor-Vickers office</A>.&nbsp;
(See also the compiler's notes below.)&nbsp;
Also included are a few items about other bell-related businesses;
these have not yet been utilized elsewhere.

Boston city directories for several representative years have been digitized for online access via the 
<A HREF="http://dl.tufts.edu/">Tufts Digital Library</A>.&nbsp; 
One is identified thus:
<pre>
   Title: The Boston directory, embracing the city record, a general directory of the 
      citizens, and a business directory for the year commencing July 1, 1870.
   Author: Sampson, Davenport, &amp; Co.
   Date: 1870
   URL: http://dl.tufts.edu/view_text.jsp?urn=tufts:central:dca:UA069:A069.005.DO.00018
</pre>
From that identification, the other directories at the same location can readily be found
by anyone who needs information that is not presented below.&nbsp;
(Exception:  The 1850 business directory is from a different source.)
<p><A NAME="DE"> </A>
<H3>Description:</H3>
The Boston city directories are similar to those from other major American cities of the 19th century.&nbsp;
The bulk of the material is an alphabetic listing (by last name) of all citizens who 
conducted, or were employed in, commercial, political or charitable operations of all kinds,
or who were heads of households.&nbsp;
This listing includes the names of commercial partnerships or enterprises.
<p>
Prefacing the alphabetic section is various descriptive material about the city.&nbsp;
In some directories, the alphabetic section is followed by a Business Directory,
which is a classified listing of various enterprises; 
this may be a brief summary or an exhaustive list.&nbsp;
Typically there will be some amount of advertising material, 
usually done with a wide variety of fancy typefaces
and sometimes including engraved images as well.
<p>
In the Tufts Digital Library (TDL), the alphabetic listing by name has been 
processed through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 
so that it is fully searchable by word or phrase.&nbsp;
Furthermore, it is indexed and paginated so that all entries with the same last name 
can be seen on a single page.&nbsp;
Other material has only been scanned as graphical page images, so it is not searchable;
small typefaces are often not entirely readable.&nbsp;
(The online directories for some years do not contain this material, or contain only parts of it.)&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, this material has been partially or completely omitted for some years of the directories;
where present, it is often poorly indexed.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, it is occasionally useful.
<p>
All relevant data from the alphabetic section of each available year 
is recorded here exactly as found in the source except for four minor editorial changes:
<br>
1)&nbsp; Where words are obviously run together, a space has been inserted for readability.
<br>
2)&nbsp; Long lines have been re-wrapped for readability.&nbsp;
(The OCR processing by TDL did not preserve original line wraps.)
<br>
3)&nbsp; A few comments have been inserted in [square brackets].&nbsp;
Some emphasize the absence of data for a particular name that is present for other years; 
others reflect the separate capture of various graphical images.
<br>
4)&nbsp; For most years, the alphabetic entries have been grouped according to the
particular business to which they are relevant.&nbsp;
Within each such group, the original alphabetic order is retained.
<p>
Any relevant data found in the graphic page images has been captured for reference 
by the compiler of this page (and mention is made of that fact), 
but for the most part it is not presented here.&nbsp;
In a few instances, information from those images has been transcribed here.
<p>
The mark [?] indicates that a transcription is questionable, 
either because the compiler of this page found a graphic image not entirely readable,
or because there appears to be an error in the digitization of the directory,
or because there is suspicion of a typographical error in the original directory.
<p>
Common abbreviations found in the data:
<br> &nbsp; bds. = boards &nbsp; [rents a room, usually with morning and evening meals included]
<br> &nbsp; h. = house &nbsp; [probably implying ownership of a single-family residence]
<br> &nbsp; &amp; Co. = and Company &nbsp; [implying that there are other investors in this commercial venture]
<br> &nbsp; st. = street &nbsp; [also implied after all other street names]
<br> &nbsp; pl. = place &nbsp; [rather than "street"]
<br> &nbsp; c. = corner &nbsp; [of two streets]

<B>Compiler's notes:</B>&nbsp;
Reading old city directories, whether in paper or online, is rather like 
reading last year's telephone directory for fun.&nbsp;
To the onlooker, it seems to be unimaginably tedious drudgery.&nbsp;
But to the compiler of data, it's like a treasure hunt - 
following clues based on what is already known,
one suddenly finds unexpected gems of new information.&nbsp;
This page, for example, sprang from a search for supporting data regarding the Hooper/Blake bellfoundry,
the history of which is only partially known.&nbsp;
Finding evidence for a Boston office representing the English manufactory of Naylor-Vickers
was an unexpected bonus, 
as it helps to explain the rather surprising number of Naylor-Vickers steel bells
which are to be found in the New England area, and indeed elsewhere in the USA.
<p>
The inclusion of the data for Foster &amp; Roby is based entirely on their appearance in
the classification "Bells" in the 1872 directory.&nbsp;
No bells bearing that name are known to American bell historians.&nbsp;
Since this firm was variously listed as brassfounders and as metal dealers,
it is conceivable that they made small bells for the use of bell hangers 
(i.e., servant call bells, etc.) 
and/or that they acted as agents for western bellfoundries.
<p>
One hopes that the TDL will complete the planned work to put the 1860 city directory online, 
along with others that would fill in some of the gaps in the data presented above.
