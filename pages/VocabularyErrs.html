            <p>
                In talking or writing about bells, there are a few frequently-encountered words that are at least
                strange, if not outright wrong.&nbsp; This page explains those words, which are NOT used on this 
                Website.&nbsp; (For the bell-related vocabulary that IS used on this Website, see our 
                <A HREF="data/Glossary.html">Glossary</A>.)

            <h2>Vocabulary Oddities</h2>
            <p>
                <b>"The chimes"</b> is one of those peculiar terms in the English language that is a plural form
                which is used as if it were singular, and for which there is actually no singular form.&nbsp;
                For example, one might hear or see the sentence, "The chimes pealed out from the tower."&nbsp;
                Obviously this refers to a set of bells; but <I>a</I> bell is not <I>a</I> chime!&nbsp;
                So we do not use this word in this sense.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead, we use "chime" in the senses defined in our <A HREF="data/Glossary.html">Glossary</A>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The word <b>campanologist</b>, which by definition means a person who studies bells,
                also has a rather odd usage in England, where some change ringers claim it for themselves
                in spite of the fact that their expertise with respect to bells is actually very narrow.&nbsp;
                Widely known campanologists include Percival Price (1901-1985) and Andr&eacute; Lehr (1929-2007).

            <h2>Vocabulary Errors</h2>
            <p>
                All too often, one hears or reads the assertion that a bell was <B>forged</B>.&nbsp;
                That is a major error, because the metal-working processes of forging and casting are utterly different.&nbsp;
                Forging is the process of heating a piece of metal (most commonly iron-based) until it is red hot
                and then hammering it into a new shape before it cools.&nbsp;
                The work of a blacksmith consists of forging artifacts of many kinds; but that does not include bells, 
                because it is impossible to produce the perfectly circular shape of a bell by this method.&nbsp;
                Instead, bells are <b>cast</b> by melting an appropriate mix of metals in a furnace
                and then pouring that melted metal into a mold, where it solidifies into the desired shape
                as it cools.&nbsp;
                Casting is typically done is a foundry, which is defined in our <A HREF="data/Glossary.html">Glossary</A>.
