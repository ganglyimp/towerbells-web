            <p>
                In talking or writing about bells, there are a few frequently-encountered words that are at least
                strange, if not outright wrong.&nbsp; This page explains those words, which are NOT used on this
                Website.&nbsp; (For the bell-related vocabulary that IS used on this Website, see our
                <a href="/towerbells-web/data/Glossary.html">Glossary</a>.)

            <h2>Vocabulary Oddities</h2>
            <p>
                <b>"The chimes"</b> is one of those peculiar terms in the English language that is a plural form which
                is used as if it were singular, and for which there is actually no singular form.&nbsp; For example, one
                might hear or see the sentence, "The chimes pealed out from the tower."&nbsp; Obviously this refers to a
                set of bells; but <i>a</i> bell is not <i>a</i> chime!&nbsp; So we do not use this word in this sense.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead, we use "chime" in the senses defined in our <a href="/towerbells-web/data/Glossary.html">Glossary</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The word <b>campanologist</b>, which by definition means a person who studies bells, also has a rather
                odd usage in England, where some change ringers claim it for themselves in spite of the fact that their
                expertise with respect to bells is actually very narrow.&nbsp; Widely known campanologists include
                Percival Price (1901-1985) and Andr√© Lehr (1929-2007).

            <h2>Vocabulary Errors</h2>
            <p>
                All too often, one hears or reads the assertion that a bell was <b>forged</b>.&nbsp; That is a major
                error, because the metal-working processes of forging and casting are utterly different.&nbsp; Forging
                is the process of heating a piece of metal (most commonly iron-based) until it is red hot and then
                hammering it into a new shape before it cools.&nbsp; The work of a blacksmith consists of forging
                artifacts of many kinds; but that does not include bells, because it is impossible to produce the
                perfectly circular shape of a bell by this method.&nbsp; Instead, bells are <b>cast</b> by melting an
                appropriate mix of metals in a furnace and then pouring that melted metal into a mold, where it
                solidifies into the desired shape as it cools.&nbsp; Casting is typically done is a foundry, which is
                defined in our <a href="/towerbells-web/data/Glossary.html">Glossary</a>.
